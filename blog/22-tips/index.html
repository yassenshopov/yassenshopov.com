        <p>
          A few weeks ago I turned 22 and wrote a thread titled &quot;<a
            href="https://twitter.com/yassenshopov/status/1564868641564360704"
            ><em
              >22 Life lessons on life design, academics, and wealth
              generation</em
            ></a
          >&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this article, I will expand a bit more on each and every one of the
          22 points. Those lessons come mostly from my experience as a content
          creator on the internet for the last 2-3 years, as well as my
          experience as an almost graduating university student.
        </p>
        <p>Let&#39;s go into it.</p>
        <h2 id="-1-keep-applying-the-80-20-rule">
          üìê 1. Keep applying the 80/20 rule
        </h2>
        <p>
          Also known as the Pareto principle, the 80/20 rule is one of the most
          popular productivity principles. It goes like this:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            For many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of
            causes.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          In simpler terms, usually about 80% of your productivity will come
          from 20% from your efforts. Most of your grades at school will come
          from a handful of difficult assignments, not equally from all of them.
          And since in most cases, we don&#39;t need to be perfectionists, we
          can save ourselves 80% of the hassle by focusing on the most important
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will take you exponentially less time to get 80% of the results
          than to get that last 20.
        </p>
        <h2 id="-2-remember-that-everyone-is-winging-it">
          üïäÔ∏è 2. Remember that everyone is winging it
        </h2>
        <p>
          Schools typically teach us to ask for permission for everything. Even
          when you are successful, you are successful within an already-existing
          frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          In life outside of school though, people tend to be far from perfect
          at what they do - a shock, I know.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Parents figure out how to &quot;parent&quot; as they go, to greater
            or smaller success.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your doctor will make a lot of assumptions while working with you,
            possibly not all of them true.
          </li>
          <li>
            Even the most law-abiding drivers will sometimes park at the wrong
            spot or forget their seatbelt.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In this culture that strives for high productivity and perfectionism,
          we must remember that all people are far from ideal, and even the best
          professionals sometimes make mistakes due to lack of knowledge,
          fatigue, a momentary lack of focus, or just bad luck.
        </p>
        <h2 id="-3-you-can-meal-prep-in-a-lot-of-life-areas">
          üç≤ 3. You can ‚Äúmeal-prep‚Äù in a lot of life areas
        </h2>
        <p>
          In order to save time, we can apply the process of
          &quot;meal-prepping&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          It means that we do the bulk of our weekly cooking on one day, for
          example Sunday, and then we store the food to eat throughout the week.
        </p>
        <p>
          How is that beneficial? Well, first of all, you reduce the total
          cooking time. You only need to heat up the oven once a week instead of
          once every day, you can be focused on cooking for a few hours instead
          of getting into the cooking zone a few times a day, and you have more
          control over what goes into your stomach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, you reduce the uncertainty during the week when you&#39;re
          actually busy. What will I eat today? Guess what, you already decided
          on that on Sunday.
        </p>
        <p>You can do &quot;meal-prep&quot; in most other life areas too.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Do your weekly planning ahead of time on Sunday, before you start
            getting busy on Monday.
          </li>
          <li>Do a monthly or fortnightly deep clean of your place.</li>
          <li>Create study schedules ahead of time instead of on-the-go.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="-4-take-advantage-of-your-long-time-horizon">
          ‚è≥Ô∏è 4. Take advantage of your long time horizon
        </h2>
        <p>
          The compound interest effect is pretty spectacular by itself, but it
          only starts really affecting your results after some time passes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since you&#39;re young, you have one of the greatest assets you could
          own at your fingertips - a long time horizon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start investing early, start working on your career early, invest in
          your health early on and you&#39;ll be much more thankful to your past
          self one day.

        <p>
          Especially in the productivity sphere, there are thousands of methods
          that probably work, to a lesser or higher degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there is a reason why a few of them are so popular (remember
          the Pareto principle?), and why they are so simple:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Pomodoro Technique</li>
          <li>Time-blocking</li>
          <li>The 2-day rule (not missing out on a habit 2 days in a row)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="-6-expect-for-things-to-go-unexpectedly">
          üå™Ô∏è 6. Expect for things to go unexpectedly
        </h2>
        <p>
          In life, in business, in your career, many things are uncertain. One
          thing that is certain though, is that things will go unexpectedly at
          some point.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may be today, tomorrow, a year from now, but you&#39;ll reach a
          point where your plan will get sidetracked or completely busted and
          you&#39;ll have to improvise.
        </p>
        <p>
          While you cannot prepare for any specific thing that could go wrong,
          you can (in most cases) put some buffer between you and total failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can secure yourself an emergency fund, make some plan Bs while you
          can, have a strong support network, etc.
        </p>
        <h2 id="-7-build-your-online-presence">
          üèóÔ∏è 7. Build your online presence
        </h2>
        <p>
          20 years ago only a select few people had a notable social presence.
        </p>
        <p>10 years ago, being <em>online</em> started being the new normal.</p>
        <p>
          Now, in 2022, almost everybody and their mum has some form of social
          presence - 99% of them as consumers, not creators.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will benefit you much more in the long term to take control of your
          online presence now. Take control of what you post, why you post it,
          where you post it. Find a niche or two you love, speak about them to
          your small audience and watch the internet spread your messages and
          content to the right people&#39;s screens.
        </p>

          ‚õÖÔ∏è 8. Wear sunscreen, even on cloudy days
        </h2>
        <p>
          When you&#39;re young, you typically don&#39;t pay too much attention
          to your skincare.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, sunscreen is shown to be one of the easiest ways to prevent
          damage to your skin, wrinkles, discoloration, and it should be applied
          daily as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may think to yourself that if you live in a relatively cold/cloudy
          country, you won&#39;t need to other, but guess what? Sunlight can be
          damaging to your skin even through the cloud barrier, albeit to a
          lesser extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          So do your future self a favour and put on your sunscreen regularly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Academia, be it high school or university, can be quite the hassle.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I first discovered
          <a href="https://kofiscrib.com/blog/creative-virgo/notion/">Notion</a>
          and its amazing perks for students, I was in my 1st year of
          university, doing Biomedical Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back then, I created some pretty resourceful notes, which I only later
          found out were helpful to my other classmates as well. What is more,
          once you share your resources, they will most likely share their own
          notes with you as well, so it&#39;s a beneficial self-reinforcing
          cycle.

        </h2>
        <p>
          We all get very busy from time to time. Still, taking 5 minutes out of
          your time to send a text, arrange a meeting, or just remember to wish
          somebody a &quot;Happy birthday!&quot; goes a long way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have created reminders for myself in Google Calendar to send a
          message on my close people&#39;s birthdays, and it&#39;s a fail-safe
          method to make sure nobody gets forgotten.

        <p>
          <em>Inbox 0</em> is the practice of actually having zero items in your
          preferred inbox.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take for example your email inbox. Any time a new email comes in, it
          has to compete for your attention with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Past mails</li>
          <li>Irrelevant spam</li>
          <li>Random emails that you keep just in case</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We tend to associate the concept of &quot;quarters of the year&quot;
          to the financial or economic sphere a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there&#39;s a reason why it&#39;s so important for much of project
          management. 3 months is a perfect time period for most projects.
          It&#39;s enough time to plan out a project, start it out, review it.
          At the end of every quarter, review your goals and work and see if
          everything aligns.

        <p>
          Data analysis [<em>Ààde…™t…ô …ôÀàn√¶l…ôs…™s</em>]: a process of inspecting,
          cleansing, transforming, and modelling data with the goal of
          discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting
          decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your decision-making should largely be affected by data. And the data
          in your life can be very quantifiable as well. Think about your gym
          stats, your weight, your sleep data, even your mood can have a number
          associated with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start tracking your numbers and you&#39;ll quickly notice patterns

        <p>
          Very few people work their dream jobs from the get-go. Learn to accept
          that the randomness at the beginning of your career is the price for
          job satisfaction later in life.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far I have been a barista, a translator, a digital illustrator, a
          technical writer. All of those jobs have taught me things, and all
          this accumulated knowledge has been compounding over time.

        <p>
          If you know just a little bit of code, you can probably automate a lot
          of things in your day-to-day life. Such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data entry</li>
          <li>Your email system</li>

        <p>
          This is good for a variety of reasons, but we often overlook the
          <em>depth</em> of the reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will definitely get much more value from a book if you take notes
          from it. Then turn those notes into content or actionable tasks in
          your day-to-day life and you will see much more benefit.

        </p>
        <p>But as much as they can hold you back, they could also help you.</p>
        <p>
          Whenever you feel scared or worried to do something, try to analyse
          the reasons why. Are you scared to do something out of a lack of
          experience, or is it because you need to change the setting somehow?

          Your fears can easily be a compass of how to make your life better.

        <p>
          However, we don&#39;t really get a choice in the matter - every single

        <p>Any content creator starts off insecure.</p>
        <p>What will people say if I start making content on the internet?</p>
        <p>
          Well, especially in the beginning, nobody will say anything. Your
          audience will be small enough that it will likely attract no real
          attention. One of the first hurdles you&#39;ll have to get over is the
          self-promotion concept.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may feel like bragging on the Internet at the beginning, but it
          will become natural over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can promote yourself and your brand without bragging by:
          <br />‚ÜíBuilding in public <br />‚ÜíSharing your tips and tricks
          <br />‚ÜíProviding value to people, for free
