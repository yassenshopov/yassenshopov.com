A few weeks ago I turned 22 and wrote a thread titled "[*22 Life lessons on life design, academics, and wealth generation*](https://twitter.com/yassenshopov/status/1564868641564360704)".

In this article, I will expand a bit more on each and every one of the 22 points. Those lessons come mostly from my experience as a content creator on the internet for the last 2-3 years, as well as my experience as an almost graduating university student.

Let's go into it.

## 📐 1. Keep applying the 80/20 rule

Also known as the Pareto principle, the 80/20 rule is one of the most popular productivity principles. It goes like this:

>For many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes.

In simpler terms, usually about 80% of your productivity will come from 20% from your efforts. Most of your grades at school will come from a handful of difficult assignments, not equally from all of them. And since in most cases, we don't need to be perfectionists, we can save ourselves 80% of the hassle by focusing on the most important things.

It will take you exponentially less time to get 80% of the results than to get that last 20.

## 🕊️  2. Remember that everyone is winging it

Schools typically teach us to ask for permission for everything. Even when you are successful, you are successful within an already-existing frame.

In life outside of school though, people tend to be far from perfect at what they do - a shock, I know.

- Parents figure out how to "parent" as they go, to greater or smaller success.
- Your doctor will make a lot of assumptions while working with you, possibly not all of them true.
- Even the most law-abiding drivers will sometimes park at the wrong spot or forget their seatbelt.

In this culture that strives for high productivity and perfectionism, we must remember that all people are far from ideal, and even the best professionals sometimes make mistakes due to lack of knowledge, fatigue, a momentary lack of focus, or just bad luck.

## 🍲 3. You can “meal-prep” in a lot of life areas

In order to save time, we can apply the process of "meal-prepping".

It means that we do the bulk of our weekly cooking on one day, for example Sunday, and then we store the food to eat throughout the week.

How is that beneficial? Well, first of all, you reduce the total cooking time. You only need to heat up the oven once a week instead of once every day, you can be focused on cooking for a few hours instead of getting into the cooking zone a few times a day, and you hav emore control over what goes into your stomach.

Moreover, you reduce the uncertainty during the week when you're actually busy. What will I eat today? Guess what, you already decided on that on Sunday.

You can do "meal-prep" in most other life areas too.

- Do your weekly planning ahead of time on Sunday, before you start getting busy on Monday.
- Do a monthly or firtnightly deep clean of your place.
- Create study schedules ahead of time instead of on-the-go.

## ⏳️ 4. Take advantage of your long time horizon

The compound interest effect is pretty spectacular by itself, but it only starts really affecting your results after some time passes.

Since you're young, you have one of the greatest assets you could own at your fingertips - a long time horizon.

Start investing early, start working on your career early, invest in your health early on and you'll be much more thankful to your past self one day.

## 🍅 5. Trust the staples

Especially in the productivity sphere, there are thousands of methods that probably work, to a lesser or higher degree.

However, there is a reason why a few of them are so popular (remember the Pareto principle?), and why they are so simple:

- The Pomodoro Technique
- Time-blocking
- The 2-day rule (not missing out on a habit 2 days in a row)

## 🌪️ 6. Expect for things to go unexpectedly

In life, in business, in your career, many things are uncertain. One thing that is certain though, is that things will go unexpectedly at some point.

It may be today, tomorrow, a year from now, but you'll reach a point where your plan will get sidetracked or completely busted and you'll have to improvise.

While you cannot prepare for any specific thing that could go wrong, you can (in most cases) put some buffer between you and total failure.

You can secure yourself an emergency fund, make some plan Bs while you can, have a strong support network, etc.

## 🏗️ 7. Build your online presence

20 years ago only a select few people had a notable social presence.

10 years ago, being *online* started being the new normal.

Now, in 2022, almost everybody and their mum has some form of social presence - 99% of them as consumers, not creators.

It will benefit you much more in the long term to take control of your online presence now. Take control of what you post, why you post it, where you post it. Find a niche or two you love, speak about them to your small audience and watch the internet spread your messages and content to the right people's screens.
