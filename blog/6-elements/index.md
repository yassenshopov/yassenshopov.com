You may have heard the saying “time is money” a few dozen times before.

Well, we can also argue that “money is time” - when you have more money, you can afford to hire people to do the stuff you don’t want to do yourself, which frees you up to do whatever you want. Yet, in society, we cannot exchange value through the means of “time” alone. It would look like a dystopian reality if we worked for *seconds* and *minutes* as a currency, don’t you think?

It makes more sense to quantify the currency numerically, through something objective - like money. But it begs the question, with both time and money, what are we actually conceptualising here?

I believe that what we substitute with “money” or “time” is what we call **value**. We create value, we receive value, and luckily, there are ways in which we can also accumulate value. 

In this article, I will explain my mental model of what makes a wealthy and fulfilling life - that is, a life with a lot of accumulated value.

To better understand this framework, we need to dive deeper in the meaning of value in our society.

Value, by definition, is “*the importance, worth, or usefulness of something*”. We can also use the word “effort” in this context. As I mentioned already, we can:

1. Generate value - by creating things, building, working, investing, spending time, essentially giving out a bit of ourselves to achieve something external.
2. Receive value - by buying things, using services, taking up space, renting, essentially any act of exchanging some sort of accumulated value for somebody else’s form of value.
3. Accumulate value - by keeping material possessions, saving money, owning real estate, essentially being in possession of some form of value that can be exchanged to receive value in return.

As you can now see, money is just one form of value you can own.

In my ponderings, and after reading some essays on the topic, I have reached the following conclusion - there are 6 important elements in life that can be used to store value. I will go over each one, but here is a list in the beginning for all of you who need a TL;DR tag.

- Money
- Data/Information
- Time
- Status
- Energy
- Soul

I must admit, the “Soul” element probably has a better name for what it stands for, but I’m using it as a placeholder till I figure it out.

Let’s start with the most obvious medium of value, money.

Money itself comes in different forms, and has been used as a store of value for as long as society has been a thing. Whether it is gold coins, paper notes, cryptocurrencies, real estate,
