            <blockquote>
            <p>‚Äú<em>If I only had an hour to chop down a tree, I would spend the first 45 minutes sharpening my axe.</em>‚Äù - <strong><em>Abraham Lincoln</em></strong></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The aforementioned quote perfectly describes one of the main laws of productivity - preparation beats action any day.</p>
            <p>And preparing for the upcoming academic year is one hell of an obstacle to act on without a plan. And, surprisingly, most people actually tackle it heads-on without a plan in mind. This is the reason why ‚Äúgood‚Äù students often continue to do moderately well til they graduate, and vice versa - <em>momentum</em>.</p>
            <p>Since we‚Äôre never taught proper study techniques, we usually follow our intuition on how studying works. We study the whole material just a few days before the exam, we postpone assignments till the last minute and generally try to minimise the time spent studying as much as we can - often at the cost of the quality of learning.</p>
            <p>However, both school and university are institutions that have existed for quite a while now. Even with the recent transition to online learning in some places, most of the underlying principles behind doing well in academia are the same. The academic year follows a relatively predictable structure, and it‚Äôs usually a repeatable one as well.</p>
            <p>For example, with my Engineering modules at Uni, I have found some patterns in the optimal study techniques for each. </p>
            <ol>
            <li>Essays follow a similar structure that you can templatise</li>
            <li>Tutorials teach you the material through repeated problem-solving</li>
            <li>Most of engineering can be boiled down to figuring out how to figure out things in a relevant context.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>What is more, preparing ahead of time and planning your goals is essential because‚Ä¶</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>‚Äú<em>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.</em>‚Äù - <em><strong>James Clear</strong>, author of ‚ÄúAtomic Habits‚Äù</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>And in this article, we will look into the <strong>systems</strong> you can purposefully build to increase your academic performance - ahead of time.</p>

            <h2 id="your-calendar">Your calendar</h2>
            <p>Most students only start using a calendar, either a physical one or a digital one, when they go into university. Personally, I have been using one even in high school, courtesy to Thomas Frank‚Äôs inspiring videos that I was lucky to stumble into when I was 16:</p>
            <iframe style="width: 100%; height: 400px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KcWplarcZzY"></iframe>
            <p>Your calendar is a powerful tool for a few reasons:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>It allows you to conceptualise how much time a task takes</li>
            <li>It helps you visualise any gaps in your schedule</li>
            <li>Helps you manage time on a 2D plane</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The last one is also the reason why I personally prefer using a digital tool like <strong>Google Calendar</strong>. It allows me to move events around, reschedule, and most importantly, attach details to events. Now I can set the location of a lecture event, to know where I‚Äôm gonna be each day. It allows me to colour code all my business tasks in yellow to differentiate them from the green fitness events that I have spread out in the week. On that note, I can have multiple calendars within one app - and toggle their visibility on and off whenever I want to isolate for a specific area of my life.</p>
            <p>So how is a calendar useful in an academic setting specifically?</p>
            <p>Well, ever since I got into uni, I also got into the habit of blocking out study time ahead of time. On a Sunday, I will look at the lectures and set-in-stone events for the following week and find out when I‚Äôll have bigger gaps in my schedule. If I happen to be on campus for the whole day, and have time between lectures, I can use that to do some studying in the library instead of going back and forth.</p>
