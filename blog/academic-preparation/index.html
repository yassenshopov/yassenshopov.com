        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The aforementioned quote perfectly describes one of the main laws of
          productivity - preparation beats action any day.
        </p>
        <p>
          And preparing for the upcoming academic year is one hell of an
          obstacle to act on without a plan. And, surprisingly, most people
          actually tackle it heads-on without a plan in mind. This is the reason
          why ‚Äúgood‚Äù students often continue to do moderately well til they
          graduate, and vice versa - <em>momentum</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we‚Äôre never taught proper study techniques, we usually follow
          our intuition on how studying works. We study the whole material just
          a few days before the exam, we postpone assignments till the last
          minute and generally try to minimise the time spent studying as much
          as we can - often at the cost of the quality of learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, both school and university are institutions that have existed
          for quite a while now. Even with the recent transition to online
          learning in some places, most of the underlying principles behind
          doing well in academia are the same. The academic year follows a
          relatively predictable structure, and it‚Äôs usually a repeatable one as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, with my Engineering modules at Uni, I have found some
          patterns in the optimal study techniques for each.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Essays follow a similar structure that you can templatise</li>
          <li>
            Tutorials teach you the material through repeated problem-solving
          </li>
          <li>
            Most of engineering can be boiled down to figuring out how to figure
            out things in a relevant context.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          What is more, preparing ahead of time and planning your goals is
          essential because‚Ä¶
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            ‚Äú<em
              >You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level
              of your systems.</em
            >‚Äù -
            <em><strong>James Clear</strong>, author of ‚ÄúAtomic Habits‚Äù</em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          And in this article, we will look into the
          <strong>systems</strong> you can purposefully build to increase your
          academic performance - ahead of time.

        <h2 id="your-calendar">Your calendar</h2>
        <p>
          Most students only start using a calendar, either a physical one or a
          digital one, when they go into university. Personally, I have been
          using one even in high school, courtesy to Thomas Frank‚Äôs inspiring
          videos that I was lucky to stumble into when I was 16:
        </p>
        <iframe
          style="width: 100%; height: 400px"
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KcWplarcZzY"
        ></iframe>
        <p>Your calendar is a powerful tool for a few reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It allows you to conceptualise how much time a task takes</li>
          <li>It helps you visualise any gaps in your schedule</li>
          <li>Helps you manage time on a 2D plane</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The last one is also the reason why I personally prefer using a
          digital tool like <strong>Google Calendar</strong>. It allows me to
          move events around, reschedule, and most importantly, attach details
          to events. Now I can set the location of a lecture event, to know
          where I‚Äôm gonna be each day. It allows me to colour code all my
          business tasks in yellow to differentiate them from the green fitness
          events that I have spread out in the week. On that note, I can have
          multiple calendars within one app - and toggle their visibility on and
          off whenever I want to isolate for a specific area of my life.
        </p>
        <p>So how is a calendar useful in an academic setting specifically?</p>
        <p>
          Well, ever since I got into uni, I also got into the habit of blocking
          out study time ahead of time. On a Sunday, I will look at the lectures
          and set-in-stone events for the following week and find out when I‚Äôll
          have bigger gaps in my schedule. If I happen to be on campus for the
          whole day, and have time between lectures, I can use that to do some
          studying in the library instead of going back and forth.
        </p>
        <p>Tip #2 for your calendar will be to allow for buffer time.</p>
        <p>
          I would describe buffer time as a countermeasure against unexpected
          delays. Say, something that often happens to me is that my laptop
          takes a long while to boot, and sometimes the loading kills
          productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why, if my schedule allows, I will set bigger time intervals
          for tasks than what I know they usually take. An ‚ÄúAssignment‚Äù task
          that usually takes an hour? I‚Äôll leave 90 minutes for it, so even if
          my laptop has the worst performance, I‚Äôll still get it done in time
          before the next event.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, for tasks that happen at different locations, it‚Äôs important to
          allow for buffer time to reach those locations.
        </p>
        <h2 id="analyse-the-80-20">Analyse the 80/20</h2>
        <p>
          We all realise that tasks are not made equal, and our effort should be
          optimised, not maximised.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, when writing an essay, you are often given the guideline
          beforehand. In my experience with Engineering assignments, they follow
          this formula - most of the points you get from the results,
          discussion, and conclusion of the article, and less points are
          allotted to the introduction and methods sections.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that if you optimise your efforts into writing an amazing
          conclusion (a bit backwards, I know), your effort will be better
          rewarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, effort is effort, but the effort can have a different
          ‚Äúreward‚Äù attached to it, depending on the way you allocate it.
        </p>
        <h2 id="get-ahead">Get ahead</h2>
        <p>You know what you can do, that many people are scared to?</p>
        <p>Ask for notes.</p>
        <p>
          We are often engulfed by the idea that we have to do everything on our
          own. Plus, for us, every subject at school or uni feels new and novel.
          This often hides the fact that those are games with preset rules - and
          other people have already walked those same routes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ask your upperclassmen for notes, you‚Äôll be surprised by the resources
          that could be available at your fingertips by just putting yourself
          out there. Also, on that note, try asking your classmates to share
          notes as well, while you‚Äôre both creating them. A shared Docs file
          that could be edited by a few people and is constantly fact-checked
          becomes invaluable as exam time approaches.
