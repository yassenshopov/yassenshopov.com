The aforementioned quote perfectly describes one of the main laws of productivity - preparation beats action any day.

And preparing for the upcoming academic year is one hell of an obstacle to act on without a plan. And, surprisingly, most people actually tackle it heads-on without a plan in mind. This is the reason why “good” students often continue to do moderately well til they graduate, and vice versa - *momentum*.

Since we’re never taught proper study techniques, we usually follow our intuition on how studying works. We study the whole material just a few days before the exam, we postpone assignments till the last minute and generally try to minimise the time spent studying as much as we can - often at the cost of the quality of learning.

However, both school and university are institutions that have existed for quite a while now. Even with the recent transition to online learning in some places, most of the underlying principles behind doing well in academia are the same. The academic year follows a relatively predictable structure, and it’s usually a repeatable one as well.

For example, with my Engineering modules at Uni, I have found some patterns in the optimal study techniques for each. 

1. Essays follow a similar structure that you can templatise
2. Tutorials teach you the material through repeated problem-solving
3. Most of engineering can be boiled down to figuring out how to figure out things in a relevant context.

What is more, preparing ahead of time and planning your goals is essential because…
