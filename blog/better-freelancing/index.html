        <p>
          Freelancing, or the practice of working on a contract-to-contract
          basis with multiple clients instead of a single employer, has been
          growing in popularity in the past years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially with the pandemic and the rise of WFH and quiet-quitting
          culture, people have been looking into ways to expand their income
          streams.
        </p>
        <p>You may ask yourself:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>Is this article for me if I am just an employee?</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          And the answer could be yes or no. I believe that most standard 9-to-5
          jobs have some sort of alternative in the freelance sphere. We have
          seen professions such as physicians, lawyers, construction workers,
          etc., turn their face towards freelance. What freelance does is
          essentially remove the 9-to-5 boundaries, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Having to work a fixed schedule</li>
          <li>Having a single income stream</li>
          <li>Limited control over your work conditions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So with so many freelancers entering the career stage in 2022, you may
          ask yourself - how do I stand out?
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily, whenever there is a large group of people, there are usually
          ways to quickly accelerate and stand out from the other 90%. In this
          article, I will go into 6 easy practices that have helped me become a
          better freelancer and shine when compared to competition.
        </p>
        <p>Starting off withâ€¦</p>
        <h2 id="1-it-s-all-about-communication">
          1. Itâ€™s all about communication
        </h2>
        <p>
          This is the prime factor which will generally differentiate between
          good freelancers and bad ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          You would honestly be surprised by how low the standard for
          communication and correspondence can get - missed deadlines, rude
          remarks, bad customer service, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          By simply following these few guidelines, you can outclass most
          freelancers in terms of good communication with your clients.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create an automatic email campaign to onboard them, giving them full
            and clear instructions and expectations from the get-go.
          </li>
          <li>Update them with progress regularly.</li>
          <li>
            Make them feel like their opinion is appreciated - ask for feedback
            at the end.
          </li>
          <li>
            Offer a refund - then make your best effort so they donâ€™t need to
            ask for it.
          </li>
          <li>Keep them in the loop with regular emails.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="2-use-the-full-time-regime">2. Use the Full-time regime</h2>
        <p>The 8-hour workday is often bashed for its lack of flexibility.</p>
        <p>
          However, when I first converted to freelance, I found it very helpful
          to still be able to adhere to the 8-hour workday for a few reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>It helps you build a schedule</li>
          <li>Itâ€™s good in case youâ€™re scatterbrained</li>
          <li>
            It usually intersects with the schedule of your clients which aids
            correspondence.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          What is more, by working 8 hours a day even as a freelancer, you can
          apply a specific strategy, which I call the 2-by-4 method.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will sometimes have yourself in the situation where you have not
          enough or entirely too many clients. In that case, I would recommend
          you spend 4h a day working on your already-assigned projects, and
          spend the remaining 4h a day working on marketing - seeking out new
          clients. This way, you will get yourself an exemplary portfolio of
          work while still managing to find new clients simultaneously.
