Freelancing, or the practice of working on a contract-to-contract basis with multiple clients instead of a single employer, has been growing in popularity in the past years.

Especially with the pandemic and the rise of WFH and quiet-quitting culture, people have been looking into ways to expand their income streams.

You may ask yourself:

> *Is this article for me if I am just an employee?*

And the answer could be yes or no. I believe that most standard 9-to-5 jobs have some sort of alternative in the freelance sphere. We have seen professions such as physicians, lawyers, construction workers, etc., turn their face towards freelance. What freelance does is essentially remove the 9-to-5 boundaries, such as:

- Having to work a fixed schedule
- Having a single income stream
- Limited control over your work conditions

So with so many freelancers entering the career stage in 2022, you may ask yourself - how do I stand out?

Luckily, whenever there is a large group of people, there are usually ways to quickly accelerate and stand out from the other 90%. In this article, I will go into 6 easy practices that have helped me become a better freelancer and shine  when compared to competition.

Starting off with…

## 1. It’s all about communication

This is the prime factor which will generally differentiate between good freelancers and bad ones.

You would honestly be surprised by how low the standard for communication and correspondence can get - missed deadlines, rude remarks, bad customer service, etc.

By simply following these few guidelines, you can outclass most freelancers in terms of good communication with your clients.

- Create an automatic email campaign to onboard them, giving them full and clear instructions and expectations from the get-go.
- Update them with progress regularly.
- Make them feel like their opinion is appreciated - ask for feedback at the end.
- Offer a refund - then make your best effort so they don’t need to ask for it.
- Keep them in the loop with regular emails.

## 2. Use the Full-time regime

The 8-hour workday is often bashed for its lack of flexibility.

However, when I first converted to freelance, I found it very helpful to still be able to adhere to the 8-hour workday for a few reasons:

- It helps you build a schedule
- It’s good in case you’re scatterbrained
- It usually intersects with the schedule of your clients which aids correspondence.

What is more, by working 8 hours a day even as a freelancer, you can apply a specific strategy, which I call the 2-by-4 method.

You will sometimes have yourself in the situation where you have not enough or entirely too many clients. In that case, I would recommend you spend 4h a day working on your already-assigned projects, and spend the remaining 4h a day working on marketing - seeking out new clients. This way, you will get yourself an exemplary portfolio of work while still managing to find new clients simultaneously.
