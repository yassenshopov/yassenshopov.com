            <p>I first started drinking coffee in 10th grade, while I was still in high school in Bulgaria.</p>
            <p>Just to preface this story, and in case you want a short summary - I never developed a problem with drinking coffee or any significant bad side effects from the whole thing. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs been a few years now that I have been drinking on average 2 cups of coffee a day. I feel like, as with any substance, it‚Äôs a good thing to reflect on the habit and to reflect on the pros and cons of being a coffee drinker.</p>
            <p>I didn‚Äôt really start drinking coffee out of necessity, it was more of a ‚Äúgrowing-up‚Äù tradition. My parents drink coffee every morning, and it was ingrained in me that it was the natural thing to do when growing up. Plus, when you put a few spoons of sugar into the mix, it becomes quite a tasty drink, even for non-drinkers.</p>
            <p>So in the beginning, it was the easiest thing in the world to integrate it into my morning routine. As I often had to wake up at 6:30 am for school, it made sense to also drink a cup of coffee while waiting for my brain to boot up. Then, after a year or two, most of my friends were also drinking coffee so it became a social thing. Coffee shops have this great conversational atmosphere that I love, and almost every outing could become a coffee shop meetup eventually.</p>
            <p>The thing was, while still in high school, I couldn‚Äôt really go over the line with coffee - my mum would know if I had a cup late into the night or if I simply had too many. So it wasn‚Äôt until I got my first job (as a barista, ironically), that I got to drink as much coffee as I wanted. On some work days, it went up to 4 cups daily, which definitely started getting me fidgety.</p>
            <p>Then came university, and with that, coffee started becoming more and more a part of my personality. I‚Äôm studying Engineering, and that goes hand-in-hand with some workload, so the running gag of engineering students having caffeine in their veins became a reality.</p>
            <p>At that point, I had already stopped getting the positive effects of caffeine, like being energetic, and instead only suffered from withdrawal on the few days I went without a cup of coffee.</p>
