          alt="How_I_Landed_my_First_100_Clients_as_an_Artist_Thumbnail"

        />

        <p>
          In March 2020, I was a newbie content creator with $0 made in sales.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just a bit more than a year later, I had already worked with 100+
          clients on digital illustrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this article, I will go over the steps I took to ensure myself some
          publicity, and how I managed to persuade so many people to work with
          an inexperienced artist.
        </p>
        <h2 id="seeing-what-works">Seeing what works</h2>
        <p>
          You would think that a digital artist can simply charge hundreds of
          dollars for their work and people would gladly pay because it‚Äôs art.
        </p>
        <p>Maybe, but only if you‚Äôre somewhat capable as an artist.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, I was far from it.</p>
        <p>
          My idea for ‚Äúdigital art‚Äù was to draw something on paper and take a
          picture of it. Here‚Äôs an example or two.
        </p>
        <img
          alt="How_I_Landed_my_First_100_Clients_as_an_Artist_Thumbnail"
          loading="lazy"
          decoding="async"
          src="../../resources/images/blog/first-100-clients/first-100-clients-1.webp"
        />
        <p>
          Of course, that didn‚Äôt exactly reach the right audience. I needed to
          transition to proper digital art.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the following weeks and months, I drew for 6+ hours a day, almost
          every day, in order to get better.
        </p>
        <p>
          And soon enough, people started to notice, there was now some amount
          of value in my art-style. See some of my more recent works for
          reference:
        </p>
        <img
          alt="How_I_Landed_my_First_100_Clients_as_an_Artist_Thumbnail"
          loading="lazy"
          decoding="async"
          src="../../resources/images/blog/first-100-clients/first-100-clients-2.webp"
        />
        <p>
          And still, it would have amounted to nothing if I just started posting
          when I felt ‚Äúready‚Äù. I took the approach of posting all the works I
          did, good or bad, on a schedule, no matter the reaction I received.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was also promoting said content on every social media channel I
          could think of. I was on Instagram, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, I had a
          Patreon, a Ko-Fi account, I also made my own website a bit later (<a
            href="http://kofiscrib.com"
            ><strong>kofiscrib.com</strong></a
          >).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Key point</strong>: You never know what works until you try it
          - so see what works and then do it again.
        </p>
        <h2 id="distinguishing-yourself">Distinguishing yourself</h2>
        <p>
          So, while I was on all those different social media channels, I
          realised something:
        </p>
        <p>‚ÄúThere are so many people who draw the same and better than me.‚Äù</p>
        <p>
          At the time as well, that was an obvious statement. And even today, I
          would not deem that I am among the best digital illustrators there
          are, far from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet, for a person to choose you to work for them on a project, you
          have to be able to distinguish yourself somehow.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where I figured it out - my style may not be the best there
          is, but that doesn‚Äôt matter too much. It‚Äôs the
          <strong><em>content</em></strong> that people will flock towards.
        </p>
        <img
          alt="How_I_Landed_my_First_100_Clients_as_an_Artist_Thumbnail"
          loading="lazy"
          decoding="async"
          src="../../resources/images/blog/first-100-clients/first-100-clients-3.webp"
        />
        <p>
          I added a bit of my personality wherever I could, I drew genuine
          stories and characters from my imagination that some people seemed to
          resonate with. The truth is, they liked the characters and stories
          mainly because they saw they were genuine and original - the rest was
          a matter of taste.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Key point</strong>: Be unique, and be yourself, when doing
          art. The rest will follow naturally.
        </p>

        <h2 id="not-being-afraid-to-ask">Not being afraid to ask</h2>
        <p>For 2 months straight, I was drawing without funding.</p>
        <p>
          Nobody cared enough to purchase a custom piece from me. And
          understandably so:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I had no social approval or testimonials</li>
          <li>My art-style was quite rough and unpolished</li>
          <li>I was very inexperienced in marketing overall</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My first dollar online actually came when I asked for it. I saw a
          person who was commissioning people online to draw for them, and I hit
          their DMs. Worst thing that could happen, they say no. But imagine my
          joy when they accepted my offer and paid me $3 to draw them something
          small.
        </p>
        <p>I know, I‚Äôm a master of sales.</p>
        <p>
          Now, $3 was nothing even back then before inflation was hitting hard,
          but it was the proof of work that mattered.
        </p>
        <p>
          My drawings were apparently valuable enough to be exchanged for a
          price. Yes, a low price, in the beginning, but it was surely a start.
          I figured I‚Äôd start charging something more reasonable from now on,
          keep asking people whether they were interested in my art, and slowly
          raise my prices over the months.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is how, 2 years into this creative endeavour, I had made ~$6,000.
          Yes, at such a big timescale it seems little to me, and probably you,
          but for somebody who was making 0 money online beforehand, this magic
          Internet money felt better than anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key point: don‚Äôt be afraid to ask. People sometimes don‚Äôt know what
          you‚Äôre offering and how much it could help them. It‚Äôs your job to
          promote, and theirs to either accept or decline.
        </p>
        <h2 id="knowing-your-audience">Knowing your audience</h2>
        <p>
          And lastly, the most important step for finding your audience is to
          know where to look for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As artists, we may think that all social media is the same and we‚Äôll
          be treated the same - that‚Äôs not true. Musicians can‚Äôt utilise the
          visual aspect of Instagram as well as digital artists, and digital
          artists can‚Äôt grown on platforms like Soundcloud, Spotify, and even
          YouTube requires extra steps to make viable.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when I was approaching an audience in the beginning of 2020, I had
          an idea in mind - since I was drawing in an anime-inspired style, why
          not go on Tumblr and see whether I get traction there?
        </p>
        <p>
          And lo and behold, I got pleasantly surprised - people on there were
          liking what I posted and were much more willing to ask for a
          commission (many people want anime art of their original characters, I
          found out). Similarly on Instagram, at first I wasn‚Äôt growing because
          I was just posting into the void. Then at one point I decided to start
          doing drawing challenges there and quickly found other people doing
          the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          The point is, your audience is out there, and they won‚Äôt need a lot of
          reassuring to start liking you - you just need to find where they
          scroll.
        </p>
