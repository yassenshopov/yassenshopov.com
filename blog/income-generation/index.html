          With the coming of the pandemic, came the rise of the WFH (work from
          home) mode of work as well. This gave a mighty push to The Great
          Resignation movement - ‚Äú<em
            ><a
              href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/11/what-is-the-great-resignation-and-what-can-we-learn-from-it/"
              >a phenomenon that describes record numbers of people leaving
              their jobs after the COVID-19 pandemic ends</a
            ></em
          >‚Äú.
        </p>
        <p>
          This increase in people working outside of the office gave rise to a
          ton of new opportunities. Why work 5 days a week when we can work for
          4? Why work 40 hours when 20-30 per week seem plenty in terms of
          productiveness? Why work all year round when you could work on
          separate projects start-to-finish? Should I really be working as an
          employee or as a freelancer?
        </p>
        <p>
          That,
          <a
            href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fhumd.2021.684137/full"
            >plus the overall increase in people spending time in front of their
            screens</a
          >, has led to a peak in the creator economy. More and more people are
          becoming content creators, especially on a freelance basis, and are
          now practising their craft - free from traditional employment.
        </p>
        <p>
          It may seem like there is no reason why everybody shouldn‚Äôt just
          become a freelance content creator. However, it comes with its risks.
          Mainly job stability and stable income.
        </p>
        <p>
          People who enter the world of freelancing often find the income
          infrequencies a huge dealbreaker. One of the main pros of being
          traditionally employed is that you can rely on income arriving in your
          checking account at the same time every month, for as long as you keep
          trading your time for money. With freelancing, you may end up having a
          month with no sales/customers, and you‚Äôll also have months where you
          have so much work you can‚Äôt take anything more.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where <strong>passive income</strong> and
          <strong>multiple streams of income</strong> come into the
          conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Freelance content creators, and content creators of all kinds, are not
          as limited in terms of income streams as you may think. Currently, you
          can choose one, or several, of those options:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Crowdfunding projects</li>
          <li>Taking in commission work in your craft</li>
          <li>Selling products</li>
          <li>Using affiliate links and ad revenue</li>
          <li>Selling courses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As a content creator, I have a few income streams that, while not
          equal in size, all bring in a bit of cash each month, and have helped
          me keep myself afloat during my almost 3 years as a freelance content
          creator.
        </p>
        <p>Starting off, we have:</p>
        <h2 id="1-crowdfunding">1. Crowdfunding</h2>
        <p>
          Patreon is probably the first thing that comes to your mind when you
          think of a <strong>crowd-funding platform</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The business model for this platform is simple and very customisable -
          people can pay a monthly price, set by you as a creator, to receive
          access to extra materials, behind-the-scenes insights, polls, QnA
          time, merch, and others. It all depends on the type of content you
          produce, and sometimes you don‚Äôt even need to offer extra stuff. Your
          followers may choose to support you there on a monthly basis as a
          token of appreciation for all the work you do for free.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as
          <strong
            ><a href="https://patreon.com/kofiscrib">my own Patreon</a></strong
          >
          is concerned, since I am a <strong>digital illustrator</strong> and
          <strong>blogger</strong> by craft, I use Patreon to release early and
          behind-the-scenes material, as well as to ask my Patrons for insights
          as VIP contacts. The cool part is that you can cancel your
          subscription at any time and you can only support a creator for as
          long as you want to.
        </p>
        <p>
          For creators, this is probably the closest you may get to regular
          income. Patreon tends to pay its users monthly, and while the amount
          can differ, you will know for certain when it‚Äôs coming, which can
          mimic the reliability of traditional jobs to an extent.
        </p>
        <h2 id="2-print-on-demand">2. Print-on-demand</h2>
        <img
          alt="Print on Demand - Income Generation"
          src="../../resources/images/blog/income-generation/income-generation-1.gif"
          loading="lazy"
          encoding="async"
        />
        <p>Or in other words, <strong>merchandise</strong>.</p>
        <p>
          Merchandise can take many forms, especially if your content creation
          revolves around art of some form. But even if it doesn‚Äôt, you‚Äôll
          surely have a brand name and/or a logo, which you can put on merch.
          Your sold products could include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mugs</li>
          <li>Hats, clothes, bags</li>
          <li>Stickers</li>
          <li>Accessories</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You may think to yourself, ‚ÄúThat sounds cool and all, but I don‚Äôt have
          the time and budget to order so much material, make my own merch, and
          sell it. Also, what if it doesn‚Äôt work out?‚Äú. This is where
          <a
            href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/kofiscrib/explore?asc=u&amp;page=1&amp;sortOrder=recent"
            >RedBubble</a
          >
          and <a href="https://printful.com/">Printful</a> come into play.
        </p>
        <p>
          RedBubble and Printful are what you would call print-on-demand
          services. You upload your designs to their websites, and then if you
          make a sale, they create your merch themselves and ship it out to the
          buyer. They cover all manufacturing and shipping costs (although they
          do take a large cut of your income, but it is more or less the same
          money you would pay for manufacturing and delivery costs, so it‚Äôs not
          unfair). It is a free-to-use platform, and it is a very scalable
          business. If you sold and made your own merch, you‚Äôd have to buy,
          let‚Äôs say, a ton of t-shirts, print your design on them, have to go to
          the post every once in a while. And for the same profit, you can have
          either one of the two companies (or why not both?) help you out.
        </p>
        <p>
          RedBubble also provides its own search engine, which means that people
          could land on your design absolutely by chance, and make a purchase.
          That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been selling stickers for a while now.

        <p>
          This is probably the most universal way to earn money as a blogger,
          writer, vlogger, video producer, streamer, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          To explain it briefly, do you see the ads on this website? Businesses
          pay Google to send out their ads to affiliates like my website. Then
          the ad is posted on my page, and every time you see or click one of
          those ads, I get a small financial kickback from it. It is not a lot
          for a small website or YouTube channel, but even if it is just a few
          cents every day, it is an income stream that builds up over time.
        </p>
        <h2 id="-4-commission-work-and-projects-">
          <strong>4. Commission work and Projects</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
          So far we have listed potential revenue streams that are passive in
          nature. This means that once you set those systems up, they will be
          running 24/7 regardless of your input - you can only grow and market
          them from then on.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, with some businesses, mine included, the main source of
          income will most probably be an active stream. By active, I mean that
          it is a job to be done, a project that needs to actively be worked on
          for the client to pay. In my case, as a digital illustrator, this type
          of work is commission work - clients can order a custom digital art
          piece from me, with characters and ideas of their choice, in my style.
        </p>
        <p>
          For different businesses, projects and active work could mean
          different things. You may offer consulting services, project
          management, software services, maintenance, and so on. This will
          potentially be your main source of revenue until the passive ones
          start increasing exponentially, so most of your work should probably
          be directed here.
        </p>
        <h2 id="5-tips-and-donations">5. Tips and donations</h2>
        <img

        <p>
          Since you are a content creator, you not only do your work, you also
          publish it online and share it on social media. This added layer of
          extra effort and publicity will surely make some people wanna support
          your endeavours, even without something in return!
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where digital ‚Äútip jars‚Äù come in handy. It is a way to get
          paid without actively providing a service, or maybe as a token of
          gratitude from a thankful customer. Usually, content creators tend to
          link to their PayPal or CashApp accounts to use as a tip jar, but
          these apps aren‚Äôt that well-crafted for a client-creator relationship.
          It ends up feeling more like a ‚ÄúGive me money‚Äù banner than anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is designed in such a way that customers and supporters can send
          you money in the form of a ‚ÄúBuy me a coffee‚Äú tip. This way it actually
          feels like they are supporting you not just financially, but also
          morally.
