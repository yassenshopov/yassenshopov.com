        <p>We can broadly categorise people into two different philosophies:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Those who believe life happens to them (external locus of control)
          </li>
          <li>
            Those who believe they are responsible for what their life becomes
            (internal locus of control)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In reality, it&#39;s true that we cannot control every little or big
          thing that happens to us, so to an extent, we can&#39;t have a
          completely internal locus of control. What we can do, however, is
          treat life as something that we make out of the randomness around us.
        </p>
        <p>
          A book that helped me visualise this concept in an amazing manner is,
          surprisingly to me, the science-fiction survival story, &quot;The
          Martian&quot;, by Andy Weir.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;The Martian&quot; follows the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut
          sent on a mission to Mars in 2035. Things go haywire really fast for
          him when an accident during evacuation leaves him stranded on the red
          planet - alone, without his team, and with no way of communicating
          with Earth. None of his crewmates knows he is alive on Mars, and he is
          left to his own devices to survive with the little resources he has.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily, Mark is a botanist by education and manages to develop a DIY
          garden for potatoes on the desolate Mars base. That, plus using what
          little leftover food he had from the mission, allowed him to
          physically survive and not die of malnourishment. This is just one
          example of the ton of ingenious tactics Mark uses to survive and to
          even attempt to return to Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this article, I will be going over the ways in which this science
          fiction novel inspired my &quot;Life Engineering&quot; philosophy, and
          how it provides a healthy mental framework for dealing with life&#39;s
          adversities.
        </p>
        <h2 id="the-survival-scenario">The Survival Scenario</h2>
        <p>
          While we are (luckily) not exposed to the elements in the same way
          Mark is, life can still be described as a battle for survival in a
          way. Yes, most of us live a relatively privileged life, knowing that
          we will always have some sort of support network to fall back on.
          However, in order to propel our lives forward, we mostly rely on our
          own capabilities and resources - the definition of survival.
        </p>
        <p>
          What fascinates me about the story in &quot;The Martian&quot; is the
          realistic storytelling. It would be a bland story if the main
          character always took the correct decisions with scientific precision
          and never got in trouble. That would read more like an instruction
          manual than a novel.

          It becomes even more interesting, because Mark Watney actually
          <em>is</em> a scientist. The decisions he takes are grounded in his
          knowledge of astronomy, physics, botanics. And still, realistically,
          his analysis sometimes overlooks something obvious, he is sometimes
          clumsy and forgetful, and even when his plan seems 100% fail-safe,
          there is always something additional to consider.
        </p>
        <p>
          This all reflects very well what it is to be a living, breathing
          human. You can definitely improve your life with some planning, but
          we‚Äôre never in full control of what happens to us.
        </p>
        <h2 id="scarcity-vs-abundance">Scarcity VS Abundance</h2>
        <img
          alt="How_Life_Is_What_We_Make_of_it_Gif"
          loading="lazy"
          decoding="async"

        <p>
          You may have heard of ‚Äúscarcity mindset‚Äù and ‚Äúabundance mindset‚Äù
          before. They refer to two different modes of thinking about the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          People with a scarcity mindset believe that there are limited
          resources in the world - not everybody can be successful, not
          everybody can be rich, and there is not enough of anything for
          everyone. This often leads them to be more stingy, overly cautious and
          protective, because of this innate fear of resources running out. And
          as you can deduce, there is not a lot of space for growth in this type
          of mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
          People with an abundance mindset, on the other hand, perceive the
          world as an endless supply of opportunities - wealth and value can be
          generated from thin air without necessarily taking from someone else.
          People like that are often more generous, take more risks, and are
          less afraid of potential losses.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my opinion, this is where personal growth truly happens. Now, back
          to ‚ÄúThe Martian‚Äù.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main character finds himself often in a situation where he has a
          limited supply. Mark can run out of food, oxygen, heat, water, and all
          of those could be fatal. However, if he had a scarcity mindset, he
          would have remained in his base for all eternity, afraid to stray away
          from his safe place, and would have never [SPOILER ALERT] returned
          back to Earth. It was the abundance mindset that got him out of the
          hole, and it was what gave him hope in the first place.
        </p>
        <h2 id="the-purposelessness-of-modern-tasks">
          The purposelessness of modern tasks
        </h2>
        <p>
          While Mark‚Äôs mission in Mars almost always consists of life-critical
          tasks and responsibilities, he manages to keep a good mood some of the
          time and doesn‚Äôt let his hope wither out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Surprisingly, the average office worker at some corporation may have
          less drive and motivation under even the most perfect working
          conditions than Mark Watney has while his life is in danger and it
          seems impossible to survive at times. However, there is a simple
          reason behind that.
        </p>
        <p>
          In modern society, we have developed business models that operate in a
          very farfetched manner. Sometimes a worker in a factory may never
          actually use the products they are creating, and often in a corporate
          setting, employees may be largely detached from the goals of the
          company. And usually, the bigger the company is, the less attachment
          the average worker has to their actual work and day-to-day tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the reason why Mark is motivated to succeed in his tasks. His
          life is always on the line. Imagine if your life was
          <strong>directly</strong> affected by your day-to-day actions - if you
          don‚Äôt make yourself a healthy dinner, you die the next day, for
          example. It‚Äôs pretty much like that for the main character in ‚ÄúThe
          Martian‚Äù, where he has to take into account almost every action of
          his, and any mistake can turn out to be fatal. Meanwhile, for us, our
          actions or inactions usually only affect us in the medium and long
          term. Everyday mediocre work may only lead you to get fired further
          down the line, if ever at all, in some jobs. If you miss out on
          workouts, it will only show when you‚Äôre 70 and pain starts forming in
          your joints.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why it‚Äôs important to strive to have a job with a mission, or
          at least one that you can closely see the effects. Higher-purpose jobs
          like vets, medics, social care workers, and others, see much higher
          ‚ÄúGratification‚Äù rates when compared to other, usually more lucrative
          professions, and it‚Äôs the sense of purposelessness that dictates that.
