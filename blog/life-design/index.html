            <img alt="How_Life_Is_What_We_Make_of_it_Thumbnail" decoding="async" src="../../resources/images/blog/life-design/Thumbnail.webp" />

            <p>We can broadly categorise people into two different philosophies:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Those who believe life happens to them (external locus of control)</li>
            <li>Those who believe they are responsible for what their life becomes (internal locus of control)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In reality, it&#39;s true that we cannot control every little or big thing that happens to us, so to an extent, we can&#39;t have a completely internal locus of control. What we can do, however, is treat life as something that we make out of the randomness around us.</p>
            <p>A book that helped me visualise this concept in an amazing manner is, surprisingly to me, the science-fiction survival story, &quot;The Martian&quot;, by Andy Weir.</p>
            <p>&quot;The Martian&quot; follows the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut sent on a mission to Mars in 2035. Things go haywire really fast for him when an accident during evacuation leaves him stranded on the red planet - alone, without his team, and with no way of communicating with Earth. None of his crewmates knows he is alive on Mars, and he is left to his own devices to survive with the little resources he has.</p>
            <p>Luckily, Mark is a botanist by education and manages to develop a DIY garden for potatoes on the desolate Mars base. That, plus using what little leftover food he had from the mission, allowed him to physically survive and not die of malnourishment. This is just one example of the ton of ingenious tactics Mark uses to survive and to even attempt to return to Earth.</p>
            <p>In this article, I will be going over the ways in which this science fiction novel inspired my &quot;Life Engineering&quot; philosophy, and how it provides a healthy mental framework for dealing with life&#39;s adversities.</p>
            <h2 id="the-survival-scenario">The Survival Scenario</h2>
            <p>While we are not (luckily) exposed to the elements in the same way Mark is, life can still be described as a battle for survival in a way. Yes, most of us live a relatively priviledged life, knowing that we will always have some sort of support network to fall back on. However, in order to propel our lives forward, we mostly rely on our own capabilities and resources - the definition of survival.</p>
            <p>What fascinates me about the story in &quot;The Martian&quot; is the realistic storytelling. It would be a bland story if the main character always took the correct decisions with scientific precision and never got in trouble. That would read more like an instruction manual than a novel.</p>
            <p>It becomes even more interesting, because Mark Watney actually <em>is</em> a scientist. The decisions he takes are grounded in his knowledge of astronomy, physics, botanics. </p>
