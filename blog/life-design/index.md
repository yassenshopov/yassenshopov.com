We can broadly categorise people into two different philosophies:

1. Those who believe life happens to them (external locus of control)
2. Those who believe they are responsible for what their life becomes (internal locus of control)

In reality, it's true that we cannot control every little or big thing that happens to us, so to an extent, we can't have a completely internal locus of control. What we can do, however, is treat life as something that we make out of the randomness around us.
