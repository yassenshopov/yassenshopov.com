In 2020, right when COVID-19 hit, my academic year in University was cut short - then I found myself with more time than expected on my hands.

I had been considering the idea of making money on the Internet for some time before that. Since my first job ever was at a local coffee shop, I had quickly realised that customer service jobs weren’t really my jam. No hard feelings on that front, I did enjoy learning tons about coffee and only occasionally running into a rude customer.

But the question remained - how does one actually proceed with making money on the Internet? Of course, I had seen quite a few success stories online, but people like that always seemed miles ahead and almost unreachable in scope.

This is when luck and boredom blessed me together in the midst of the first lock-down. I had enough time on my hands to revisit my old passion for art - and more particularly, digital art. I had a graphic tablet in one of my drawers, nothing expensive, just enough to bring my drawings to the digital canvas. And let me tell you, my initial drawings in those first months were *decent* at best. You can see for yourself over here, it’s quite humbling to see what almost all amateur art starts off as.

My first commissioned drawing came around April 2020, and it was for the magnificent 3$! I was in awe, I could actually make money through my art, and this spirit has been with me ever since.

It was a given though, that I needed to hone my art skills quite substantially if I wanted to keep the money machine running. That first digital art commission was a bit closer to a donation anyway, and it wasn’t because my art was a masterpiece at all. However, it was enough to incentivise me, and give me momentum to get it started. I was now a digital content creator!

## How I built an income stream

The first few commissions came from Instagram, where I have been building an audience for a while. Here is a bit of hope for you: I think I had ~500 followers at the time of my first commission, and they have since increased to almost 9k at this point in time.

However, I had to increase my reach somehow - my posts in the beginning were simply not reaching enough people who would consider commissioning me draw digital art for them. So I decided to move forward with some social media expansion.

Twitter was a viable option at the time, but there is one reason why Twitter didn’t work for me in terms of digital art. It was because of the types of users it attracts. The average Twitter art enjoyer follows so many different art accounts that your drawing simply disappears into the void most of the time. Even a true fan may end up not seeing it because of the pure volume of content being created by the second. We could argue that a similar problem exists in Instagram, but at least your “Profile” section remains consolidated and actually resembles a portfolio. This means that when someone happens to visit your profile, they are still exposed to your portfolio of drawings, and may end up following you. With Twitter, it’s a tad bit more difficult in that regard.

Surprisingly, my art found good success on Tumblr. Tumblr is a relatively unknown social media nowadays, but it used to be the OG blogging platform. It is currently the best place for people in different fandoms to catch up on fanarts, fanfictions, and other artistic material. I was so pleasantly surprised that Tumble people actually liked my content that I wrote another blog post on the [topic of Tumblr as a social platform for creators](”https://kofiscrib.com/blog/creative-virgo/is-tumblr-dead”).
