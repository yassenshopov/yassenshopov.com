I first discovered Notion when I was just 19, in Year 1 of my Engineering course at university.

It was round about time for my exams, and I had to consolidate a ton of papers, notebooks, and study materials to prepare for one heave set of studying. This is when I stumbled upon a [video by no other than Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODl5FOMu8kI&t=696s). It pointed to this fascinating notes app that combined databases, simple pages, and was automatically syncing on all devices as you wrote. This app is **Notion**.

Fast-forward 2-3 years, and now Notion is an integral part of my day-to-day productivity. I have created interconnected study planners with it that helped me move with Distinction into Year 2 and Year 3 of uni, I am tracking my sleep and well-being data on Notion daily, and I am using it to manage my freelancing business. It’s also the place where I’m currently writing this article.

I have recommended Notion to many people so far, and one of the main complaints I hear is that “Notion is simply too complicated”. You can create databases, relations, roll-ups, you can use formulas, progress bars, graphs, and more. This creates a rather steep learning curve that makes many people drop Notion before they even start to unravel the sleek functionality and cool designs they can make.

This is where *templates* come in. Templates, as you may guess, are a way to preset and configure Notion to carry out a particular set of tasks. These templates can then be duplicated with just a click of a button, and anybody can have the same system in their own respective workspace. In this article, I will provide you with 4 unique templates that have helped me get my life in order. For the impatient among you, here is what you will be getting:

1. The University HQ Template
2. The Financial Goals and Budgeting Template
3. The Daily Tracking Database
4. The Investing and Net Worth Dashboard

And now, let’s get started with the template that has helped me manage my academic life so far…
