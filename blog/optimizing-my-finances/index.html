        <p>
          I‚Äôll be turning 22 this year. So far, ever since I was 18, I‚Äôve had a
          normal job as a barista, and mainly did freelance ever after, to this
          day actually.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you‚Äôre still a student in university, and your income isn‚Äôt
          really great either, your ability to save and optimise your finances
          naturally develops. The alternative is to remain with empty pockets,
          which, while kind of expected while being a student, is nevertheless a
          harsh feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was through reading financial books that I figured out the
          importance of saving and investing. Here‚Äôs a list of them, in the
          order I read them, so you can get a clear picture of how my thinking
          developed.

            <p>
              This book taught me the basic principles of income and expenses.
              It‚Äôs generally considered the best 1st book you can read on the
              topic of personal finances. Some of the main topics it covers are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Liabilities VS Assets</li>
              <li>
                The differences between freelancers, employees, and
                businesspeople
              </li>
              <li>Inflation</li>
              <li>Why investing is important</li>
              <li>Investing VS Saving</li>
              <li>Short-term VS Long-term thinking</li>

            <p>
              For me this is the most influential of all the books in this list
              - it has taught thousands of people around the work how to achieve
              financial wellbeing and actually get rich through simple means. It
              goes into detail on the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Is it that important to cut out on lattes? (being frugal)</li>
              <li>
                How you can focus on the Big Wins instead of the Small Cuts
              </li>
              <li>Principles of investing</li>
              <li>Index funds, ETFs, Bonds, Target Date Funds (TDFs)</li>

            </p>
            <p>
              As the name suggests, the book is a short one, and it helps
              justify some investing ideas, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>How to make better research of a stock</li>
              <li>How to not let the market eat your money</li>

              Now this is a classic in the genre. Truthfully, it‚Äôs mainly geared
              towards middle-aged US citizens, but it teaches the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Debt - how to get rid of it or use it productively</li>
              <li>How to escape the rat race</li>
              <li>Thinking long-term about mortgages</li>

              This is one of the longer books in the list, and it works better
              as a manual, than as a simple book. It provides you with
              guidelines on how to live in 3 ways - as a Sidewalker, Slowlaner,
              and Fastlaner. It teaches the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>How to find a business niche</li>
              <li>How to use your business to generate personal wealth</li>

              This book was the most psychological of the list, expectedly so
              from the headline. It goes over some concepts that we rarely give
              thought to, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Why poor people gamble</li>
              <li>Why different generations invest their money differently</li>
              <li>What financial security means to different people</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Overall, these books lead me to generate a financial mantra and plan
          for myself, that I try my best to stick to. Of course, the plan
          sometimes deviates from the original idea, but the main concepts it
          follows are achieving financial freedom, preparing oneself for market
          volatility, and diversification. Let‚Äôs go over the ways I optimise my
          financials as a 22 year old, beginning with‚Ä¶

          You may have heard the saying that the average person is one medical
          emergency or car breakdown away from homelessness and poverty. It‚Äôs
          very easy to be pushed off-track, and especially when you‚Äôre young,
          your network may not be stable enough to support your eventual
          falling.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why many of the authors in the book listed above advise you to
          create an <em>emergency fund</em>. It‚Äôs called like so because you
          aren‚Äôt supposed to use it for anything that isn‚Äôt an emergency. It
          should be a moderate amount of money (the value fluctuates from person
          to person, the idea is to bring you a sense of security), that you
          have stashed away in an easily-accessible bank account. It‚Äôs supposed
          to be liquid money - if you have it invested in something, withdrawing
          it in case of emergency will result in either a loss, tons of fees, or
          both. For me, a starting emergency fund for my modest income is about
          600$, enough to get me through a month without having to pull from any
          investments.
        </p>
        <p>Speaking of investments‚Ä¶</p>
        <h2 id="investing-strategy">Investing Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          What I have learnt from the books I‚Äôve read on investing and personal
          finances so far, is that the earlier we start investing, the better.
          ‚Äú<em>Time in the market beats timing the market</em>‚Äù, as they say.
        </p>
        <p>
          So for me it was a big thing and very crucial to start investing as
          early as possible, with very small sums to start with. I‚Äôm a bit
          ashamed to admit that my first ever ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù was triggered by the
          Gamestop frenzy of 2020, and as expected, it resulted in a loss.
          However, instead of discouraging me, it made me realise that this was
          just the ‚Äúentrance fee‚Äù to the University of Investing. A much bigger
          financial loss would have been to never go into investing in the first
          place. Also, it taught me several other things, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Don‚Äôt be greedy</li>
          <li>Think of the long term</li>
          <li>Do your diligent research of the stock/index</li>
          <li>Expect volatility</li>
          <li>Don‚Äôt panic sell</li>
          <li>Don‚Äôt act on emotions, act on rationale</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So, to get to the meat of my investing strategy, as Ramit Sethi
          recommends, I take advantage of my relatively young age and longer
          time horizon, and I am all-in on stocks in the moment. My current
          portfolio is 80% SP500 ETFs (an index fund that tracks the top 500 US
          companies), around 15% in Bitcoin (to take advantage of the crypto
          bear market), and the remaining 5% is in random stocks that I have put
          some spare cash in occasionally.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thing with investing while young is that you have to get used to
          being in the red a lot. Just a small percentage of investors is
          consistently in the green just 2 years into their investing journey.
          However, once a decade has passed, I am pretty confident that the
          growth of the bulk of my portfolio would make it hard for it to ever
          go in the red.
