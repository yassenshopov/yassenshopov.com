        <p>Do we need success to achieve success?</p>
        <p>
          This is what I was asking myself after scrolling Twitter for a while.
          I‚Äôm sure many of you can imagine the situation I was in.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a content creator and a person who wants to sound smart online, I
          want to have an attractive Twitter profile. This means one of two
          things - I should either provide some sort of value or provide some
          sort of entertainment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although, you could argue, entertainment is its own sort of value.
        </p>
        <p>
          And since I don‚Äôt find myself particularly funny, and I spend more
          time building Notion templates and doing web design than much else, I
          had to go with the former - <em>provide value</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily, this is also what the experts recommend - Gary Vee and Justin
          Welsh would both agree with me on the fact that you should first
          provide value, and then expect something in return, either a follow or
          a sale.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried to take inspiration from some of my favourite online creators,
          people who I believe actually bring value with their work:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Thomas Frank</li>
          <li>Easlo</li>
          <li>Ali Abdaal</li>
          <li>Matt D‚ÄôAvella</li>
          <li>Justin Welsh</li>
          <li>Red Gregory</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And I noticed not one, but a few common threads (not the Twitter type
          of threads üßµ).
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            They all built things that inspired people
            <ol>
              <li>
                Ali Abdaal showed students how to study effectively, using
                himself as example
              </li>
              <li>
                Easlo built numerous minimalistic Notion templates that sold
                hundreds of times
              </li>
              <li>
                Justin Welsh sold his course of writing mastery to thousands of
                people
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            They achieved success using their own products
            <ol>
              <li>Ali was a top student at Cambridge</li>
              <li>Easlo manages his life with Notion</li>
              <li>
                Justin became one of the most influential writers on Twitter and
                LinkedIn
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          And this made me once again question myself. These people can now
          educate others on all the success they have amassed, and people will
          gladly follow them and buy from them, since they are inspired. Then
          how can I, who haven‚Äôt yet achieved a conventional level of success
          (still a student trying to pay bills on time and stay on top of
          things), achieve a similar level of success?
        </p>
        <p>
          In this article, I will go over some of the ways in which
          already-successful people hold an advantage against most of us - and
          then we‚Äôll go into how we can still become successful in spite of
          that. Here‚Äôs a <strong>TLDR</strong> for those of you without the
          virtue of patience right now:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Success attracts more success when used as leverage</li>
          <li>Beginners can‚Äôt utilise that, so they naturally never start</li>
          <li>
            The solution = success is malleable, and can be redefined to suit
            you
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="the-flywheel-effect">The Flywheel Effect</h2>
        <p>The flywheel effect is often associated with business ventures.</p>
        <p>
          It boils down to this - achievements breed more achievements. A
          continuous flow of positive emotions and ticked boxes on your to-do
          list will make it much more likely for more success to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take for example Thomas Frank,
          <a href="https://yassenshopov.com/blog/thomas-frank/"
            >whose creative journey I explored in this article</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thomas had a following from his days as a beginner YouTuber, that has
          scaled immensely ever since. His current following makes it easy for
          him to pursue other niches - he will surely have a portion of his
          audience that will buy almost anything from him. It would be much more
          difficult for somebody with no social validation under their belt to
          venture out into a random topic and achieve success.
        </p>
        <p>
          This logic fits well with chapter 1 of Jordan Peterson‚Äôs book, ‚Äú12
          Rules for Life‚Äù. He advises young people to fake an appearance of
          confidence, even if they do not feel it‚Äôs genuine. This is because the
          opposite of confidence is self-doubt, and this default state of
          self-doubt does more harm than a default state of self-confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          So this must mean that success does lead to more success? I‚Äôd say so,
          definitely.
        </p>
        <p>And yet, luckily for us‚Ä¶</p>

          Lack of experience ‚â† Excuse for not starting
        </h2>
        <p>
          It would be perfect if you got a default audience of 100k followers on
          Twitter when you signed up. Any of your tweets would be discussed,
          people would talk with you and give you ideas on what to write about,
          you would be a rock-star.
        </p>
        <p>And yet, how are you different from any other person on the web?</p>
        <p>
          Just like any other currency, social currency (likes, retweets,
          follows) mean something when they are scarce. If it was that easy to
          become a social media superstar, it wouldn‚Äôt mean anything. And still,
          like any other currency, it is perfectly achievable to accumulate more
          of it even if you start at 0.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of the people I listed above started with 0 followers at one
          point. Their first 10 subscribers were probably their friends and
          family, and they are ever-evolving creators, who will grow more and
          more. What we see, however, is a static image - a person with X amount
          of followers, making Y$/month, having Z amount of passive income
          streams.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lack of experience is definitely discouraging, but guess what the
          inspirational bit is? Everybody started out with 0 experience at some
          point, they just managed to accumulate it at some point, either fast
          or slow, early or late. And now you observe the static image of their
          success as if it appeared overnight.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >This is all very optimistic and all, but so what? How can I make
            people follow me if I have nothing to stand for it?</em
          >
          - you probably ask
        </p>
        <p>
          And that‚Äôs the best question after all, this is what I was wondering
          in the beginning as well. The solution seems simple, but it took me an
          episode of Game of Thrones to realise it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It happened when Tyrion, a dwarf with many enemies in the city and a
          lot of responsibilities, talked with Varys, Master of Whisperers. The
          quote went as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            ‚ÄúHere, then. Power resides where men <em>believe</em> it resides. No
            more and no less.‚Äù
          </p>
          <p>‚ÄúSo power is a mummer‚Äôs trick?‚Äù</p>
          <p>
            ‚ÄúA shadow on the wall,‚Äù Varys murmured, ‚Äúyet shadows can kill. And
            ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow.‚Äù
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>‚ÄúShadow‚Äù in our case, is equal to success.</p>
        <p>
          The shadow of success can be cast by any person in the world, even
          you. You are not in control of the flames which cast light (those are
          the life events outside of your control, metaphorically speaking), but
          you are in control of yourself. You can reposition yourself, move,
          twist, and the shadow you cast will grow bigger or smaller.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enough with the metaphors, let‚Äôs give 2 examples to make it easier to
          understand.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Imagine you are conventionally rich, self-made, and happy. However,
            if you can‚Äôt market yourself well, you may end up being seen as
            boring, overly-confident, or undeserving of your wealth. Such fate
            often occurs to famous people with poor PR.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now imagine the opposite. You are still poor, struggling, and
            unhappy. But if you market yourself as striving, hard-working, and
            clever, people will see it as an <em>underdog</em> story. A story
            about a soon-to-be winner. And you‚Äôll win the attention of people
            who wish to see you succeed.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I hope this article (which turned into a philosophical essay half-way
          through) made you realise something - success is largely subjective,
          and like the shadow on the wall, it can be modified to suit your
          needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if you‚Äôre already ready with your new Twitter bio, go and write
          it up.
        </p>
        <p>I know I will.</p>
