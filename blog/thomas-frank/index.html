        <p>
          If you‚Äôre using Notion professionally, and ever needed to Google how
          to do something in Notion, chances are high that you have stumbled
          upon <strong>Thomas Frank</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thomas is one of the most popular productivity YouTubers world-wide,
          among the ranks of Matt D‚ÄôAvella and Ali Abdaal. His main YouTube
          channel now amasses 2.5+ million subscribers, while his secondary
          blooming channel about Notion specifically is currently at ~100K - an
          amazing number given how niche of a topic Notion still is. Thomas‚Äô
          relatability, charisma, and fascination with building systems are what
          attracts fans to his work, and he has built a genuine and supporting
          following over the years.
        </p>

            alt="Thomas Frank&#39;s Creative Journey"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          I personally started interacting with his content in my high school
          years, so around 2015-2016.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was one of the first YouTubers I saw that were explaining topics
          such as productivity, study techniques, folder organisation, email
          management, etc. in a light-hearted and easy-to-follow manner. His
          short e-book ‚Äú<strong
            ><a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/"
              >10 Steps to Earning Awesome Grades</a
            ></strong
          >‚Äù also greatly inspired me to actually do well academically. From
          then on, Thomas has been branching out of the field of general
          productivity and in more niche topics such as Notion, personal
          finances, and life management. His messages are partially what
          inspired this blog series as well -
          <em
            >using engineering principles to achieve wealth, health, and
            prosperity</em
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this article, we will go over Thomas Frank‚Äôs journey as a creator,
          and we‚Äôll pinpoint his exact successful strategies over the years.
          Surely this would be helpful to any new creator on the digital scene.
          Now, drums please, and let‚Äôs go into Thomas Frank‚Äôs first venture into
          the digital content world‚Ä¶
        </p>
        <h2>College Info Geek and book-writing</h2>
        <p>
          ‚ÄúCollege Info Geek‚Äù is the platform that Thomas Frank was initially
          using to publish his content.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main focus were study articles specifically geared towards college
          students but very helpful to all types of students regardless. These
          articles were often accompanied by videos, where Thomas Frank‚Äôs
          charisma and talent really shone. He created elaborate and detailed
          guides on how to do well on exams, take on your student loans and how
          to find your 1st job in the market.
        </p>
        <p>
          This collection of articles and guides ultimately led to him creating
          a full-fledged digital product - his book, ‚Äú10 Steps to Earning
          Awesome Grades‚Äù.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is still available for free on his website, as it always has. This
          is what fascinated me as a student - who creates such an awesome and
          actually helpful guide just to distribute it for free?
        </p>
        <p>A smart guy, that‚Äôs who.</p>
        <p>
          Thomas realised something about his main audience of students. They
          aren‚Äôt among the best-paid classes, and pushing a paid product to such
          an audience will likely result in backlash. Other creators like Ali
          Abdaal frequently receive backlash when they promote their courses
          that cost hundreds of dollars, despite the fact that nobody is
          obligated to buy those products in the 1st place. So if Thomas had
          listed this product as a paid one, it would likely attract a much
          lower level of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, now that it was free, us students could just mention the
          book to a friend and they would have the ability to view it
          obstacle-free. This is how I got many of my friends to know about
          Thomas Frank‚Äôs work. His free content was powerful enough to attract
          an audience of grateful students, that would later keep up-to-date
          with his other work as they advanced through uni/college.
        </p>
        <p>
          And while all
          <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/start/"
            >those e-materials are still out there</a
          >, Thomas has been deviating from the study niche for quite a while.
          And this also has its strategic importance as he said so himself. The
          more time passes since he has last been in academia himself, the
          larger the gap becomes between himself and his target audience. This
          could potentially lead to a disconnect between him and his audience,
          so he decided to venture out into open waters - turning his attention
          to YouTube.

        <h2 id="youtube-a-career-in-action">YouTube - A career in action</h2>
        <p>Thomas Frank is currently most popular with his YouTube content.</p>
        <p>
          His content that was initially geared towards students was now
          applicable to a more general audience. He started routinely publishing
          content around his productivity habits, goal-setting, and he kept on
          providing valuable tech tips. Here are just a few of the topics he
          covered:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tech setups</li>
          <li>Self-discipline</li>
          <li>Online learning</li>
          <li>Lifelong learning</li>
          <li>Working from home</li>
          <li>Motivation and dopamine</li>
          <li>Stress and procrastination</li>
          <li>Athletism</li>
          <li>Writing (essays, articles, books)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          His popularity started really skyrocketing. His relatability and
          principles-first approach to work made him stand out. Plus, unlike
          some other productivity Youtubers that didn‚Äôt necessarily have the
          basis on which to build, Thomas already had a few years of experience
          with content creation and his YouTube brand was a natural continuation
          of that.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>So what did he do right?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          It‚Äôs difficult to pinpoint exactly at what point his channel took off
          - and that‚Äôs the cool part.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike some other YouTubers, Thomas seems to rely very little on the
          algorithm to produce content. He has a schedule and style of work that
          helps him consistently produce high-quality work with consistently
          high view-rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is more, his content rarely relies on some current events to keep
          going - making it relatively timeless in nature. You can find some
          tips and tricks from his content both as a teen and as a working
          adult, which is a strong quality.
        </p>
