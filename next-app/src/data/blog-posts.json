      "content": "Dopamine - a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the brain’s **reward** and **pleasure** centers. It is involved in many important functions, including motivation, memory, and attention.\n\nThe release of dopamine in the brain is closely tied to our sense of pleasure and reward. When we experience something pleasurable, such as eating our favorite food or spending time with loved ones, our brain releases dopamine, which helps us feel happy and motivated. This is why dopamine is often referred to as the “feel-good” neurotransmitter. It helps us feel motivated to do the things we love, and it helps us feel satisfied when we achieve our goals.\n\nHowever, dopamine is not just involved in feelings of pleasure and reward. It is also important for our ability to focus and pay attention. When we are faced with a task that requires our concentration, our brain releases dopamine to help us focus and stay on track.\n\nIn this article, we will go over the ways in which dopamine affects us mentally and physically, so you can keep it in mind when managing your work.\n\n![What_Is_Dopamine_Gif](../../resources/images/blog/dopamine/dopamine-1.gif)\n\nDopamine - the productivity stimulus\n------------------------------------\n\nWe are used to seeing the word “dopamine” being directly or indirectly linked to productivity and motivation.\n\nThink about it, on a plain level, there is not a physical manifestation of something being pleasurable or not. By that I mean, if you’re a robot equipped with all sensory organs (the ability to see, feel textures, hear, etc.), you would still be unable to make decisions as to what to touch, see or do. This is because you have no straightforward mechanism of knowing what is going to “benefit” you - evolutionary or not.\n\nSo in order to create an incentive-reward system to control our own behaviour, we evolved to have those neurotransmitters you’ve been hearing about, including dopamine.\n\nThis is why dopamine is often considered an important neurotransmitter for productivity and motivation. When our brain has enough dopamine, we are able to concentrate, stay motivated, and achieve our goals.\n\nAnd while this system works perfectly fine to make us eat food so we don’t starve to death, our current needs have evolved to be far more than purely physiological.\n\nThis is why it’s harder to choose the long-term gratification that takes effort to acquire as opposed to the short-term quick dopamine hits that our world provides.\n\nHow does quick dopamine affect us?\n----------------------------------\n\nQuick dopamine refers to the rapid release of dopamine in response to a pleasurable stimulus. This can happen in a number of ways, such as taking drugs that increase dopamine levels, engaging in risky or thrilling activities, or engaging in addictive behaviors such as gambling or excessive shopping.\n\nWhen dopamine is released quickly and in large amounts, it can have a number of effects on the brain.\n\nFor one, it can create a sense of pleasure and reward that can motivate people to engage in the behavior again in the future. This is why quick dopamine release is often associated with addictive behaviors – the rapid release of dopamine can create a sense of pleasure that makes people want to repeat the behavior over and over.\n\nHowever, the effects of quick dopamine release on the brain can also be negative. Over time, the brain becomes accustomed to the high levels of dopamine and may not respond as strongly to it in the future. This can lead to a condition known as dopamine tolerance, in which a person needs to engage in more and more of the behavior in order to experience the same level of pleasure.\n\nAdditionally, quick dopamine release can also lead to changes in the brain's structure and function. Research has shown that chronic exposure to high levels of dopamine can lead to changes in the brain's reward pathways, which can make it more difficult for a person to feel pleasure from natural rewards such as food or social interactions. This can lead to a number of negative consequences, such as social isolation, relationship problems, and mental health issues.\n\nDopamine fasting\n----------------\n\n![What_Is_Dopamine_Gif](../../resources/images/blog/dopamine/dopamine-2.gif)\n\n**Dopamine fasting** is a technique that involves avoiding activities and substances that increase dopamine levels in the brain, such as drugs, excessive caffeine consumption, and highly stimulating activities. The goal of a dopamine fast is to allow the brain to reset its dopamine levels and become more sensitive to natural rewards. Some people use dopamine fasts as a way to break free from addictive behaviors or to improve their overall mental and emotional wellbeing. A dopamine fast typically involves engaging in activities that promote mindfulness and relaxation, such as meditation and deep breathing, and avoiding excessive stress.\n\nTo make a dopamine fast, a person can follow these steps:\n\n1.  Avoid activities and substances that release dopamine quickly and in large amounts, such as drugs, alcohol, and excessive caffeine consumption.\n2.  Avoid activities that are highly stimulating or pleasurable, such as gambling, excessive exercise, and excessive screen time.\n3.  Engage in activities that promote mindfulness and relaxation, such as meditation, deep breathing, and yoga.\n4.  Eat a balanced and healthy diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.\n5.  Get plenty of sleep and rest.\n6.  Avoid excessive stress and practice healthy coping mechanisms such as talking to a therapist or counselor.\n7.  Consider participating in a dopamine fast for a set period of time, such as a day or a week, to allow the brain to reset and recalibrate its dopamine levels.\n8.  After the dopamine fast, gradually reintroduce pleasurable activities and substances in moderation, paying attention to how they affect the brain and mood.",

      "content": "With the coming of the pandemic, came the rise of the WFH (work from home) mode of work as well. This gave a mighty push to The Great Resignation movement - “_[a phenomenon that describes record numbers of people leaving their jobs after the COVID-19 pandemic ends](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/11/what-is-the-great-resignation-and-what-can-we-learn-from-it/)_“.\n\nThis increase in people working outside of the office gave rise to a ton of new opportunities. Why work 5 days a week when we can work for 4? Why work 40 hours when 20-30 per week seem plenty in terms of productiveness? Why work all year round when you could work on separate projects start-to-finish? Should I really be working as an employee or as a freelancer?\n\nThat, [plus the overall increase in people spending time in front of their screens](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fhumd.2021.684137/full), has led to a peak in the creator economy. More and more people are becoming content creators, especially on a freelance basis, and are now practising their craft - free from traditional employment.\n\nIt may seem like there is no reason why everybody shouldn’t just become a freelance content creator. However, it comes with its risks. Mainly job stability and stable income.\n\nPeople who enter the world of freelancing often find the income infrequencies a huge dealbreaker. One of the main pros of being traditionally employed is that you can rely on income arriving in your checking account at the same time every month, for as long as you keep trading your time for money. With freelancing, you may end up having a month with no sales/customers, and you’ll also have months where you have so much work you can’t take anything more.\n\nThis is where **passive income** and **multiple streams of income** come into the conversation.\n\nFreelance content creators, and content creators of all kinds, are not as limited in terms of income streams as you may think. Currently, you can choose one, or several, of those options:\n\n*   Crowdfunding projects\n*   Taking in commission work in your craft\n*   Selling products\n*   Using affiliate links and ad revenue\n*   Selling courses\n\nAs a content creator, I have a few income streams that, while not equal in size, all bring in a bit of cash each month, and have helped me keep myself afloat during my almost 3 years as a freelance content creator.\n\nStarting off, we have:\n\n1\\. Crowdfunding\n----------------\n\nPatreon is probably the first thing that comes to your mind when you think of a **crowd-funding platform**.\n\nThe business model for this platform is simple and very customisable - people can pay a monthly price, set by you as a creator, to receive access to extra materials, behind-the-scenes insights, polls, QnA time, merch, and others. It all depends on the type of content you produce, and sometimes you don’t even need to offer extra stuff. Your followers may choose to support you there on a monthly basis as a token of appreciation for all the work you do for free.\n\nAs far as **[my own Patreon](https://patreon.com/kofiscrib)** is concerned, since I am a **digital illustrator** and **blogger** by craft, I use Patreon to release early and behind-the-scenes material, as well as to ask my Patrons for insights as VIP contacts. The cool part is that you can cancel your subscription at any time and you can only support a creator for as long as you want to.\n\nFor creators, this is probably the closest you may get to regular income. Patreon tends to pay its users monthly, and while the amount can differ, you will know for certain when it’s coming, which can mimic the reliability of traditional jobs to an extent.\n\n2\\. Print-on-demand\n-------------------\n\n![Print on Demand - Income Generation](../../resources/images/blog/income-generation/income-generation-1.gif)\n\nOr in other words, **merchandise**.\n\nMerchandise can take many forms, especially if your content creation revolves around art of some form. But even if it doesn’t, you’ll surely have a brand name and/or a logo, which you can put on merch. Your sold products could include:\n\n*   Mugs\n*   Hats, clothes, bags\n*   Stickers\n*   Accessories\n\nYou may think to yourself, “That sounds cool and all, but I don’t have the time and budget to order so much material, make my own merch, and sell it. Also, what if it doesn’t work out?“. This is where [RedBubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/kofiscrib/explore?asc=u&page=1&sortOrder=recent) and [Printful](https://printful.com/) come into play.\n\nRedBubble and Printful are what you would call print-on-demand services. You upload your designs to their websites, and then if you make a sale, they create your merch themselves and ship it out to the buyer. They cover all manufacturing and shipping costs (although they do take a large cut of your income, but it is more or less the same money you would pay for manufacturing and delivery costs, so it’s not unfair). It is a free-to-use platform, and it is a very scalable business. If you sold and made your own merch, you’d have to buy, let’s say, a ton of t-shirts, print your design on them, have to go to the post every once in a while. And for the same profit, you can have either one of the two companies (or why not both?) help you out.\n\nRedBubble also provides its own search engine, which means that people could land on your design absolutely by chance, and make a purchase. That’s how I’ve been selling stickers for a while now.\n\n3\\. Ad revenue\n--------------\n\n![Ad Revenue - Income Generation](../../resources/images/blog/income-generation/income-generation-3.webp)\n\nThis is probably the most universal way to earn money as a blogger, writer, vlogger, video producer, streamer, etc.\n\nTo explain it briefly, do you see the ads on this website? Businesses pay Google to send out their ads to affiliates like my website. Then the ad is posted on my page, and every time you see or click one of those ads, I get a small financial kickback from it. It is not a lot for a small website or YouTube channel, but even if it is just a few cents every day, it is an income stream that builds up over time.\n\n**4\\. Commission work and Projects**\n------------------------------------\n\nSo far we have listed potential revenue streams that are passive in nature. This means that once you set those systems up, they will be running 24/7 regardless of your input - you can only grow and market them from then on.\n\nHowever, with some businesses, mine included, the main source of income will most probably be an active stream. By active, I mean that it is a job to be done, a project that needs to actively be worked on for the client to pay. In my case, as a digital illustrator, this type of work is commission work - clients can order a custom digital art piece from me, with characters and ideas of their choice, in my style.\n\nFor different businesses, projects and active work could mean different things. You may offer consulting services, project management, software services, maintenance, and so on. This will potentially be your main source of revenue until the passive ones start increasing exponentially, so most of your work should probably be directed here.\n\n5\\. Tips and donations\n----------------------\n\n![Tips and Donations - Income Generation](../../resources/images/blog/income-generation/income-generation-2.gif)\n\nSince you are a content creator, you not only do your work, you also publish it online and share it on social media. This added layer of extra effort and publicity will surely make some people wanna support your endeavours, even without something in return!\n\nThis is where digital “tip jars” come in handy. It is a way to get paid without actively providing a service, or maybe as a token of gratitude from a thankful customer. Usually, content creators tend to link to their PayPal or CashApp accounts to use as a tip jar, but these apps aren’t that well-crafted for a client-creator relationship. It ends up feeling more like a “Give me money” banner than anything.\n\nIt is designed in such a way that customers and supporters can send you money in the form of a “Buy me a coffee“ tip. This way it actually feels like they are supporting you not just financially, but also morally.",

      "content": "In March 2020, I was a newbie content creator with $0 made in sales.\n\nJust a bit more than a year later, I had already worked with 100+ clients on digital illustrations.\n\nIn this article, I will go over the steps I took to ensure myself some publicity, and how I managed to persuade so many people to work with an inexperienced artist.\n\nSeeing what works\n-----------------\n\nYou would think that a digital artist can simply charge hundreds of dollars for their work and people would gladly pay because it’s art.\n\nMaybe, but only if you’re somewhat capable as an artist.\n\nIn the beginning, I was far from it.\n\nMy idea for “digital art” was to draw something on paper and take a picture of it. Here’s an example or two.\n\n![How_I_Landed_my_First_100_Clients_as_an_Artist_Thumbnail](../../resources/images/blog/first-100-clients/first-100-clients-1.webp)\n\nOf course, that didn’t exactly reach the right audience. I needed to transition to proper digital art.\n\nIn the following weeks and months, I drew for 6+ hours a day, almost every day, in order to get better.\n\nAnd soon enough, people started to notice, there was now some amount of value in my art-style. See some of my more recent works for reference:\n\n![How_I_Landed_my_First_100_Clients_as_an_Artist_Thumbnail](../../resources/images/blog/first-100-clients/first-100-clients-2.webp)\n\nAnd still, it would have amounted to nothing if I just started posting when I felt “ready”. I took the approach of posting all the works I did, good or bad, on a schedule, no matter the reaction I received.\n\nI was also promoting said content on every social media channel I could think of. I was on Instagram, Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, I had a Patreon, a Ko-Fi account, I also made my own website a bit later ([**kofiscrib.com**](http://kofiscrib.com)).\n\n**Key point**: You never know what works until you try it - so see what works and then do it again.\n\nDistinguishing yourself\n-----------------------\n\nSo, while I was on all those different social media channels, I realised something:\n\n“There are so many people who draw the same and better than me.”\n\nAt the time as well, that was an obvious statement. And even today, I would not deem that I am among the best digital illustrators there are, far from it.\n\nAnd yet, for a person to choose you to work for them on a project, you have to be able to distinguish yourself somehow.\n\nThis is where I figured it out - my style may not be the best there is, but that doesn’t matter too much. It’s the **_content_** that people will flock towards.\n\n![How_I_Landed_my_First_100_Clients_as_an_Artist_Thumbnail](../../resources/images/blog/first-100-clients/first-100-clients-3.webp)\n\nI added a bit of my personality wherever I could, I drew genuine stories and characters from my imagination that some people seemed to resonate with. The truth is, they liked the characters and stories mainly because they saw they were genuine and original - the rest was a matter of taste.\n\n**Key point**: Be unique, and be yourself, when doing art. The rest will follow naturally.\n\nNot being afraid to ask\n-----------------------\n\nFor 2 months straight, I was drawing without funding.\n\nNobody cared enough to purchase a custom piece from me. And understandably so:\n\n*   I had no social approval or testimonials\n*   My art-style was quite rough and unpolished\n*   I was very inexperienced in marketing overall\n\nMy first dollar online actually came when I asked for it. I saw a person who was commissioning people online to draw for them, and I hit their DMs. Worst thing that could happen, they say no. But imagine my joy when they accepted my offer and paid me $3 to draw them something small.\n\nI know, I’m a master of sales.\n\nNow, $3 was nothing even back then before inflation was hitting hard, but it was the proof of work that mattered.\n\nMy drawings were apparently valuable enough to be exchanged for a price. Yes, a low price, in the beginning, but it was surely a start. I figured I’d start charging something more reasonable from now on, keep asking people whether they were interested in my art, and slowly raise my prices over the months.\n\nThis is how, 2 years into this creative endeavour, I had made ~$6,000. Yes, at such a big timescale it seems little to me, and probably you, but for somebody who was making 0 money online beforehand, this magic Internet money felt better than anything.\n\nKey point: don’t be afraid to ask. People sometimes don’t know what you’re offering and how much it could help them. It’s your job to promote, and theirs to either accept or decline.\n\nKnowing your audience\n---------------------\n\nAnd lastly, the most important step for finding your audience is to know where to look for it.\n\nAs artists, we may think that all social media is the same and we’ll be treated the same - that’s not true. Musicians can’t utilise the visual aspect of Instagram as well as digital artists, and digital artists can’t grown on platforms like Soundcloud, Spotify, and even YouTube requires extra steps to make viable.\n\nSo when I was approaching an audience in the beginning of 2020, I had an idea in mind - since I was drawing in an anime-inspired style, why not go on Tumblr and see whether I get traction there?\n\nAnd lo and behold, I got pleasantly surprised - people on there were liking what I posted and were much more willing to ask for a commission (many people want anime art of their original characters, I found out). Similarly on Instagram, at first I wasn’t growing because I was just posting into the void. Then at one point I decided to start doing drawing challenges there and quickly found other people doing the same.\n\nThe point is, your audience is out there, and they won’t need a lot of reassuring to start liking you - you just need to find where they scroll.",

This means one of two things - I should either provide some sort of value or provide some sort of entertainment.\n\nAlthough, you could argue, entertainment is its own sort of value.\n\nAnd since I don’t find myself particularly funny, and I spend more time building Notion templates and doing web design than much else, I had to go with the former - _provide value_.\n\nLuckily, this is also what the experts recommend - Gary Vee and Justin Welsh would both agree with me on the fact that you should first provide value, and then expect something in return, either a follow or a sale.\n\nI tried to take inspiration from some of my favourite online creators, people who I believe actually bring value with their work:\n\n*   Thomas Frank\n*   Easlo\n*   Ali Abdaal\n*   Matt D’Avella\n*   Justin Welsh\n*   Red Gregory\n\nAnd I noticed not one, but a few common threads (not the Twitter type of threads 🧵).\n\n1.  They all built things that inspired people\n    1.  Ali Abdaal showed students how to study effectively, using himself as example\n    2.  Easlo built numerous minimalistic Notion templates that sold hundreds of times\n    3.  Justin Welsh sold his course of writing mastery to thousands of people\n2.  They achieved success using their own products\n    1.  Ali was a top student at Cambridge\n    2.  Easlo manages his life with Notion\n    3.  Justin became one of the most influential writers on Twitter and LinkedIn\n\nAnd this made me once again question myself. These people can now educate others on all the success they have amassed, and people will gladly follow them and buy from them, since they are inspired. Then how can I, who haven’t yet achieved a conventional level of success (still a student trying to pay bills on time and stay on top of things), achieve a similar level of success?\n\nIn this article, I will go over some of the ways in which already-successful people hold an advantage against most of us - and then we’ll go into how we can still become successful in spite of that. Here’s a **TLDR** for those of you without the virtue of patience right now:\n\n1.  Success attracts more success when used as leverage\n2.  Beginners can’t utilise that, so they naturally never start\n3.  The solution = success is malleable, and can be redefined to suit you\n\nThe Flywheel Effect\n-------------------\n\nThe flywheel effect is often associated with business ventures.\n\nIt boils down to this - achievements breed more achievements. A continuous flow of positive emotions and ticked boxes on your to-do list will make it much more likely for more success to follow.\n\nTake for example Thomas Frank, [whose creative journey I explored in this article](https://yassenshopov.com/blog/thomas-frank/).\n\nThomas had a following from his days as a beginner YouTuber, that has scaled immensely ever since. His current following makes it easy for him to pursue other niches - he will surely have a portion of his audience that will buy almost anything from him. It would be much more difficult for somebody with no social validation under their belt to venture out into a random topic and achieve success.\n\nThis logic fits well with chapter 1 of Jordan Peterson’s book, “12 Rules for Life”. He advises young people to fake an appearance of confidence, even if they do not feel it’s genuine. This is because the opposite of confidence is self-doubt, and this default state of self-doubt does more harm than a default state of self-confidence.\n\nSo this must mean that success does lead to more success? I’d say so, definitely.\n\nAnd yet, luckily for us…\n\nLack of experience ≠ Excuse for not starting\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIt would be perfect if you got a default audience of 100k followers on Twitter when you signed up. Any of your tweets would be discussed, people would talk with you and give you ideas on what to write about, you would be a rock-star.\n\nAnd yet, how are you different from any other person on the web?\n\nJust like any other currency, social currency (likes, retweets, follows) mean something when they are scarce. If it was that easy to become a social media superstar, it wouldn’t mean anything. And still, like any other currency, it is perfectly achievable to accumulate more of it even if you start at 0.\n\nAll of the people I listed above started with 0 followers at one point. Their first 10 subscribers were probably their friends and family, and they are ever-evolving creators, who will grow more and more. What we see, however, is a static image - a person with X amount of followers, making Y$/month, having Z amount of passive income streams.\n\nA lack of experience is definitely discouraging, but guess what the inspirational bit is? Everybody started out with 0 experience at some point, they just managed to accumulate it at some point, either fast or slow, early or late. And now you observe the static image of their success as if it appeared overnight.\n\n_This is all very optimistic and all, but so what? How can I make people follow me if I have nothing to stand for it?_ - you probably ask\n\nAnd that’s the best question after all, this is what I was wondering in the beginning as well. The solution seems simple, but it took me an episode of Game of Thrones to realise it.\n\nIt happened when Tyrion, a dwarf with many enemies in the city and a lot of responsibilities, talked with Varys, Master of Whisperers. The quote went as follows:\n\n> “Here, then. Power resides where men _believe_ it resides. No more and no less.”\n> \n> “So power is a mummer’s trick?”\n> \n> “A shadow on the wall,” Varys murmured, “yet shadows can kill. And ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow.”\n\n“Shadow” in our case, is equal to success.\n\nThe shadow of success can be cast by any person in the world, even you. You are not in control of the flames which cast light (those are the life events outside of your control, metaphorically speaking), but you are in control of yourself. You can reposition yourself, move, twist, and the shadow you cast will grow bigger or smaller.\n\nEnough with the metaphors, let’s give 2 examples to make it easier to understand.\n\n1.  Imagine you are conventionally rich, self-made, and happy. However, if you can’t market yourself well, you may end up being seen as boring, overly-confident, or undeserving of your wealth. Such fate often occurs to famous people with poor PR.\n2.  Now imagine the opposite. You are still poor, struggling, and unhappy. But if you market yourself as striving, hard-working, and clever, people will see it as an _underdog_ story. A story about a soon-to-be winner. And you’ll win the attention of people who wish to see you succeed.\n\nI hope this article (which turned into a philosophical essay half-way through) made you realise something - success is largely subjective, and like the shadow on the wall, it can be modified to suit your needs.\n\nNow, if you’re already ready with your new Twitter bio, go and write it up.\n\nI know I will.",

      "content": "Imagine you’re an online creator. ✨\n\nA web designer.\n\nA traditional artist.\n\nA knitter.\n\nA video-maker.\n\nA writer.\n\nA consultant.\n\nAny person who by one form of another provides a service that can be marketed online.\n\nThis means that you’ll need a way to showcase your current abilities and past work. Your future clients and buyers will need to see what you have to offer before they commit to pay you.\n\nA portfolio will be a very powerful asset to your brand, and I stand firmly on this position.\n\nI used to do digital illustrations extensively for ~2 years, and many of my clients reacted positively to my ever-expanding portfolio, raising my conversion noticeably.\n\n![\"Digital Illustration Portfolio kofiscrib\"](../../resources/images/blog/making-a-website/making-a-website-1.webp)\n\nThis is an example preview, you can see [my full portfolio here](http://kofiscrib.com).\n\nIn this article, I will go through 3 ways you can build a powerful and converting portfolio for your work, using my digital illustration business as an example.\n\nLet’s start with the most-preferred option, which is…\n\n1\\. Using a Website builder\n---------------------------\n\nWebsite builders are created for people who want to have a website but do not have the coding skills necessary or just want to have an easier time drag-and-dropping their website components.\n\nAlso called “no-code tools”, these builders allow you to access a gallery of different website templates to choose from. You choose your template and then fill out your own copy, pictures, and so on.\n\nHere are some popular examples for website builders:\n\n*   SquareSpace\n*   Wix.com\n*   WordPress\n*   Shopify\n*   Mailchimp\n\nWhat are the differences between those websites? Here’s a short summary:\n\n### Squarespace\n\nPros:\n\n✔ **_Very_** wide gallery of templates\n\n✔ Easiest to use in my experience\n\n✔ Integrations with newsletters\n\n✔ Very easy to maintain a blog schedule\n\nCons:\n\n✘ Rather expensive\n\n✘ Limited level of customisation\n\n✘ Rather low page speed for your website\n\n### Wix.com\n\nPros:\n\n✔ Excellent site speed\n\n✔ Almost 0 downtime, very reliable\n\n✔ Better drag-and-drop experience than Squarespace\n\nCons:\n\n✘ Can’t use analytics on a free plan\n\n✘ Can’t transfer your website away from Wix\n\n✘ Templates cannot be changed easily\n\n### WordPress\n\nPros:\n\n✔ Most popular website builder (>40% of all websites use WordPress)\n\n✔ Cheapest website builder on the market\n\n✔ A very wide array of plugins\n\nCons:\n\n✘ Needs to be updated very often\n\n✘ Gets expensive when it comes to customisation\n\n✘ More susceptible to hacks\n\n### Shopify, Mailchimp, etc.\n\nPros:\n\n✔ Service is usually free when you use their other services\n\n✔ Allows for custom domains\n\nCons:\n\n✘ Website building is not the main function of the company\n\n✘ Only a few integrations are available\n\n2\\. Building one yourself (for coders)\n--------------------------------------\n\n![](../../resources/images/blog/making-a-website/making-a-website-2.webp)\n\nThis is the route most coders take.\n\nEven if you aren’t a front-end developer, and you specialise in other types of coding, you would still find it easier than most people to create a simple website from scratch.\n\nThis is how I created the website on which you are reading this article ([yassenshopov.com](http://yassenshopov.com)). I initially had my digital illustration website ([kofiscrib.com](http://kofiscrib.com)) hosted on Squarespace, that was before I learned how to code. Then the high price of Squarespace made me reconsider 6 months ago, and since then I have kofiscrib.com as a hand-built and designed website.\n\nBuilding your own website has many positives, such as:\n\n*   All the customisation you can wish for\n*   Endless expansion\n*   You control all parameters, such as the page speed\n*   Easily transferrable\n\nSo if you happen to wish for all these positives, BUT you can’t imagine coding a website all on your own, you can think about…\n\n3\\. Hire a web developer\n------------------------\n\nThis sounds like an expensive option, right? It doesn’t need to be.\n\nYes, web developer agencies and even individual developers may charge a lot for their services, but sometimes what you need is just a basic website set up for you.\n\nAnd if that’s the case, then you may be in luck.\n\nThere are many developers on sites like Fiverr, Upwork, and other freelance websites, who offer their services for relatively cheap 💸. The reason is they are actively trying to build a portfolio, just like you. They need projects for said portfolio and will be eager to work on your website against moderate compensation.\n\nSo keep this in mind when creating your portfolio. There are many ways to do it right - it’s the effort that matters. 🏋️",

      "content": "If you’re using Notion professionally, and ever needed to Google how to do something in Notion, chances are high that you have stumbled upon **Thomas Frank**.\n\nThomas is one of the most popular productivity YouTubers world-wide, among the ranks of Matt D’Avella and Ali Abdaal. His main YouTube channel now amasses 2.5+ million subscribers, while his secondary blooming channel about Notion specifically is currently at ~100K - an amazing number given how niche of a topic Notion still is. Thomas’ relatability, charisma, and fascination with building systems are what attracts fans to his work, and he has built a genuine and supporting following over the years.\n\n![Thomas Frank's Creative Journey](../../resources/images/blog/thomas-frank/thomas-frank-1.webp)\n\nI personally started interacting with his content in my high school years, so around 2015-2016.\n\nHe was one of the first YouTubers I saw that were explaining topics such as productivity, study techniques, folder organisation, email management, etc. in a light-hearted and easy-to-follow manner. His short e-book “**[10 Steps to Earning Awesome Grades](https://collegeinfogeek.com/)**” also greatly inspired me to actually do well academically. From then on, Thomas has been branching out of the field of general productivity and in more niche topics such as Notion, personal finances, and life management. His messages are partially what inspired this blog series as well - _using engineering principles to achieve wealth, health, and prosperity_.\n\nIn this article, we will go over Thomas Frank’s journey as a creator, and we’ll pinpoint his exact successful strategies over the years. Surely this would be helpful to any new creator on the digital scene. Now, drums please, and let’s go into Thomas Frank’s first venture into the digital content world…\n\nCollege Info Geek and book-writing\n----------------------------------\n\n“College Info Geek” is the platform that Thomas Frank was initially using to publish his content.\n\nThe main focus were study articles specifically geared towards college students but very helpful to all types of students regardless. These articles were often accompanied by videos, where Thomas Frank’s charisma and talent really shone. He created elaborate and detailed guides on how to do well on exams, take on your student loans and how to find your 1st job in the market.\n\nThis collection of articles and guides ultimately led to him creating a full-fledged digital product - his book, “10 Steps to Earning Awesome Grades”.\n\nIt is still available for free on his website, as it always has. This is what fascinated me as a student - who creates such an awesome and actually helpful guide just to distribute it for free?\n\nA smart guy, that’s who.\n\nThomas realised something about his main audience of students. They aren’t among the best-paid classes, and pushing a paid product to such an audience will likely result in backlash. Other creators like Ali Abdaal frequently receive backlash when they promote their courses that cost hundreds of dollars, despite the fact that nobody is obligated to buy those products in the 1st place. So if Thomas had listed this product as a paid one, it would likely attract a much lower level of interest.\n\nMeanwhile, now that it was free, us students could just mention the book to a friend and they would have the ability to view it obstacle-free. This is how I got many of my friends to know about Thomas Frank’s work. His free content was powerful enough to attract an audience of grateful students, that would later keep up-to-date with his other work as they advanced through uni/college.\n\nAnd while all [those e-materials are still out there](https://collegeinfogeek.com/start/), Thomas has been deviating from the study niche for quite a while. And this also has its strategic importance as he said so himself. The more time passes since he has last been in academia himself, the larger the gap becomes between himself and his target audience. This could potentially lead to a disconnect between him and his audience, so he decided to venture out into open waters - turning his attention to YouTube.\n\nYouTube - A career in action\n----------------------------\n\nThomas Frank is currently most popular with his YouTube content.\n\nHis content that was initially geared towards students was now applicable to a more general audience. He started routinely publishing content around his productivity habits, goal-setting, and he kept on providing valuable tech tips. Here are just a few of the topics he covered:\n\n*   Tech setups\n*   Self-discipline\n*   Online learning\n*   Lifelong learning\n*   Working from home\n*   Motivation and dopamine\n*   Stress and procrastination\n*   Athletism\n*   Writing (essays, articles, books)\n\nHis popularity started really skyrocketing. His relatability and principles-first approach to work made him stand out. Plus, unlike some other productivity Youtubers that didn’t necessarily have the basis on which to build, Thomas already had a few years of experience with content creation and his YouTube brand was a natural continuation of that.\n\n> So what did he do right?\n\nIt’s difficult to pinpoint exactly at what point his channel took off - and that’s the cool part.\n\nUnlike some other YouTubers, Thomas seems to rely very little on the algorithm to produce content. He has a schedule and style of work that helps him consistently produce high-quality work with consistently high view-rates.\n\nWhat is more, his content rarely relies on some current events to keep going - making it relatively timeless in nature. You can find some tips and tricks from his content both as a teen and as a working adult, which is a strong quality.\n\n_Thomas Frank Explains_ and Notion\n----------------------------------\n\nThomas Frank’s latest endeavours combine his passion for productivity and organisation and his experience as a content creator. He was one of the first YouTubers that I saw turn to Notion for their content creation (he has an amazing template entirely dedicated to video production).\n\nThomas has realised the potential of the Notion niche. It is full of dedicated and curious people, and since Notion is a relatively young software, it attracts an ever-growing audience. What is more, there is an urgent need for more tutorials being made, as Notion releases more and more features. This is where Thomas found a great market fit - his already-existing expertise on video-making and teaching combined with his genuine passion for Notion make him one of the best-suited people to enter this market.\n\nWhat is even more exciting, is that the Notion team apparently regularly talks with Thomas on what can be included or fixed with the software. Since Thomas has such a big audience that greatly overlaps with the Notion one, it only makes sense for both parties to be interested in working with each other.\n\nThomas Frank and his overall experience with content creation of all kinds makes him a person to look up to, so I suggest you give him a follow on Twitter to stay in the loop.\n\n> I just made $100,000 in a single month selling [@NotionHQ](https://twitter.com/NotionHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) templates through [@Gumroad](https://twitter.com/gumroad?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). Here's how:  \n>   \n> \\- Built an audience w/ tutorials and free templates  \n> \\- Spent a LOT of time on the sales page  \n> \\- Product bundles  \n> \\- Upgraded the customer experience everywhere  \n>   \n> Here are the details: [pic.twitter.com/uTMAmXq70E](https://t.co/uTMAmXq70E)\n> \n> — Thomas Frank (@TomFrankly) [May 9, 2022](https://twitter.com/TomFrankly/status/1523730922633191424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)",

      "content": "A few weeks ago I turned 22 and wrote a thread titled \"[_22 Life lessons on life design, academics, and wealth generation_](https://twitter.com/yassenshopov/status/1564868641564360704)\".\n\nIn this article, I will expand a bit more on each and every one of the 22 points. Those lessons come mostly from my experience as a content creator on the internet for the last 2-3 years, as well as my experience as an almost graduating university student.\n\nLet's go into it.\n\n📐 1. Keep applying the 80/20 rule\n----------------------------------\n\nAlso known as the Pareto principle, the 80/20 rule is one of the most popular productivity principles. It goes like this:\n\n> For many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes.\n\nIn simpler terms, usually about 80% of your productivity will come from 20% from your efforts. Most of your grades at school will come from a handful of difficult assignments, not equally from all of them. And since in most cases, we don't need to be perfectionists, we can save ourselves 80% of the hassle by focusing on the most important things.\n\nIt will take you exponentially less time to get 80% of the results than to get that last 20.\n\n🕊️ 2. Remember that everyone is winging it\n-------------------------------------------\n\nSchools typically teach us to ask for permission for everything. Even when you are successful, you are successful within an already-existing frame.\n\nIn life outside of school though, people tend to be far from perfect at what they do - a shock, I know.\n\n*   Parents figure out how to \"parent\" as they go, to greater or smaller success.\n*   Your doctor will make a lot of assumptions while working with you, possibly not all of them true.\n*   Even the most law-abiding drivers will sometimes park at the wrong spot or forget their seatbelt.\n\nIn this culture that strives for high productivity and perfectionism, we must remember that all people are far from ideal, and even the best professionals sometimes make mistakes due to lack of knowledge, fatigue, a momentary lack of focus, or just bad luck.\n\n🍲 3. You can “meal-prep” in a lot of life areas\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to save time, we can apply the process of \"meal-prepping\".\n\nIt means that we do the bulk of our weekly cooking on one day, for example Sunday, and then we store the food to eat throughout the week.\n\nHow is that beneficial? Well, first of all, you reduce the total cooking time. You only need to heat up the oven once a week instead of once every day, you can be focused on cooking for a few hours instead of getting into the cooking zone a few times a day, and you have more control over what goes into your stomach.\n\nMoreover, you reduce the uncertainty during the week when you're actually busy. What will I eat today? Guess what, you already decided on that on Sunday.\n\nYou can do \"meal-prep\" in most other life areas too.\n\n*   Do your weekly planning ahead of time on Sunday, before you start getting busy on Monday.\n*   Do a monthly or fortnightly deep clean of your place.\n*   Create study schedules ahead of time instead of on-the-go.\n\n⏳️ 4. Take advantage of your long time horizon\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe compound interest effect is pretty spectacular by itself, but it only starts really affecting your results after some time passes.\n\nSince you're young, you have one of the greatest assets you could own at your fingertips - a long time horizon.\n\nStart investing early, start working on your career early, invest in your health early on and you'll be much more thankful to your past self one day.\n\n🍅 5. Trust the staples\n-----------------------\n\nEspecially in the productivity sphere, there are thousands of methods that probably work, to a lesser or higher degree.\n\nHowever, there is a reason why a few of them are so popular (remember the Pareto principle?), and why they are so simple:\n\n*   The Pomodoro Technique\n*   Time-blocking\n*   The 2-day rule (not missing out on a habit 2 days in a row)\n\n🌪️ 6. Expect for things to go unexpectedly\n-------------------------------------------\n\nIn life, in business, in your career, many things are uncertain. One thing that is certain though, is that things will go unexpectedly at some point.\n\nIt may be today, tomorrow, a year from now, but you'll reach a point where your plan will get sidetracked or completely busted and you'll have to improvise.\n\nWhile you cannot prepare for any specific thing that could go wrong, you can (in most cases) put some buffer between you and total failure.\n\nYou can secure yourself an emergency fund, make some plan Bs while you can, have a strong support network, etc.\n\n🏗️ 7. Build your online presence\n---------------------------------\n\n20 years ago only a select few people had a notable social presence.\n\n10 years ago, being _online_ started being the new normal.\n\nNow, in 2022, almost everybody and their mum has some form of social presence - 99% of them as consumers, not creators.\n\nIt will benefit you much more in the long term to take control of your online presence now. Take control of what you post, why you post it, where you post it. Find a niche or two you love, speak about them to your small audience and watch the internet spread your messages and content to the right people's screens.\n\nNot sure what to write about? Here's a powerful thread on the topic:\n\n> How to generate 100 ideas to write about in 30 minutes - even if you think you have nothing to say (THREAD):\n> \n> — Dickie Bush 🚢 (@dickiebush) [January 19, 2022](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1483610267896459264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n⛅️ 8. Wear sunscreen, even on cloudy days\n-----------------------------------------\n\nWhen you're young, you typically don't pay too much attention to your skincare.\n\nHowever, sunscreen is shown to be one of the easiest ways to prevent damage to your skin, wrinkles, discoloration, and it should be applied daily as well.\n\nYou may think to yourself that if you live in a relatively cold/cloudy country, you won't need to other, but guess what? Sunlight can be damaging to your skin even through the cloud barrier, albeit to a lesser extent.\n\nSo do your future self a favour and put on your sunscreen regularly.\n\n(Bonus tip: take Vitamin D as well, especially if you live in the UK)\n\n![22_Tips_from_a_22_Year_Old_Content_Creator_Thumbnail](../../resources/images/blog/22-tips/22-tips-1.webp)\n\n🎓️ 9. Share notes and tactics with your classmates/coursemates\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAcademia, be it high school or university, can be quite the hassle.\n\nWhen I first discovered [Notion](https://kofiscrib.com/blog/creative-virgo/notion/) and its amazing perks for students, I was in my 1st year of university, doing Biomedical Engineering.\n\nBack then, I created some pretty resourceful notes, which I only later found out were helpful to my other classmates as well. What is more, once you share your resources, they will most likely share their own notes with you as well, so it's a beneficial self-reinforcing cycle.\n\n✔️ 10. Set up reminders to check up on people\n---------------------------------------------\n\nWe all get very busy from time to time. Still, taking 5 minutes out of your time to send a text, arrange a meeting, or just remember to wish somebody a \"Happy birthday!\" goes a long way.\n\nI have created reminders for myself in Google Calendar to send a message on my close people's birthdays, and it's a fail-safe method to make sure nobody gets forgotten.\n\n📭️ 11. Aim for Inbox 0\n-----------------------\n\n_Inbox 0_ is the practice of actually having zero items in your preferred inbox.\n\nTake for example your email inbox. Any time a new email comes in, it has to compete for your attention with:\n\n*   Past mails\n*   Irrelevant spam\n*   Random emails that you keep just in case\n\nLuckily for you, [I have written an entire step by step article](https://kofiscrib.com/blog/creative-virgo/how-to-manage-email) on how you can effortlessly create a system to organise your existing emails, unsub from the useless ones and keep the inbox clean at all times.\n\n🍀 12. Quarters aren’t just for finances bros\n---------------------------------------------\n\nWe tend to associate the concept of \"quarters of the year\" to the financial or economic sphere a lot.\n\nBut there's a reason why it's so important for much of project management. 3 months is a perfect time period for most projects. It's enough time to plan out a project, start it out, review it. At the end of every quarter, review your goals and work and see if everything aligns.\n\n🔗 13. Keep your portfolio updated\n----------------------------------\n\nUs students tend to sometimes underestimate the power of a good portfolio and a working LinkedIn profile.\n\nUniversity will come to an end soon, and the job search will begin. You'll need to list your strengths, your abilities, your experience, and you'll be able to make the best description of your uni experience while still at uni.\n\n💤 14. Make your bed first thing in the morning\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nIt's a small win! But a win nonetheless.\n\n💻 15. Use data analysis on your own life\n-----------------------------------------\n\nData analysis \\[_ˈdeɪtə əˈnæləsɪs_\\]: a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modelling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.\n\nYour decision-making should largely be affected by data. And the data in your life can be very quantifiable as well. Think about your gym stats, your weight, your sleep data, even your mood can have a number associated with it.\n\nStart tracking your numbers and you'll quickly notice patterns forming.\n\n🧨 16. Your first (few) jobs may not be the most exciting\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nVery few people work their dream jobs from the get-go. Learn to accept that the randomness at the beginning of your career is the price for job satisfaction later in life.\n\nSo far I have been a barista, a translator, a digital illustrator, a technical writer. All of those jobs have taught me things, and all this accumulated knowledge has been compounding over time.\n\n🤖 17. Automate one menial task every week\n------------------------------------------\n\nIf you know just a little bit of code, you can probably automate a lot of things in your day-to-day life. Such as:\n\n*   Data entry\n*   Your email system\n*   Your folder and file system\n*   Calendar management\n*   Daily routines\n\n🔖 18. Don’t simply _read_ non-fiction\n--------------------------------------\n\nMany people claim to read a ton of books every year.\n\nThis is good for a variety of reasons, but we often overlook the _depth_ of the reading.\n\nYou will definitely get much more value from a book if you take notes from it. Then turn those notes into content or actionable tasks in your day-to-day life and you will see much more benefit.\n\n☕ 19. Learn to appreciate caffeine\n----------------------------------\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant.\n\nAnd still, it is widely accepted in society despite its addictive nature. I even wrote an article going into [the ways I actively manage my daily caffeine](https://yassenshopov.com/blog/caffeine-addiction/). Nowadays, I stick to just 1-2 cups of coffee a day, in order to facilitate the most productivity with the least side effects.\n\n😨 20. Your fears can be a compass\n----------------------------------\n\nYour fears, anxieties, and troubles can affect how you behave and what you run towards.\n\nBut as much as they can hold you back, they could also help you.\n\nWhenever you feel scared or worried to do something, try to analyse the reasons why. Are you scared to do something out of a lack of experience, or is it because you need to change the setting somehow?\n\nYour fears can easily be a compass of how to make your life better.\n\n💰 21. Read finance books\n-------------------------\n\nPersonal finance may not be everybody's favourite genre, and that's normal.\n\nHowever, we don't really get a choice in the matter - every single one of us deals with finances, so it's better to be educated about it.\n\nHere's a list of some top-notch finance books to add to your To-Read-List:\n\n1.  “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” by R. Kiyosaki\n2.  “I Will Teach You To Be Rich” by R. Sethi\n3.  “The Little Book That Still Beats the Market” by J. Greenblatt\n4.  “The Total Money Makeover” by D. Ramsey\n5.  “The Millionaire Fastlane” by MJ DeMarco\n6.  “The Psychology of Money” by M. Housel\n\n[Here is an explanation of why every book is important over here](https://yassenshopov.com/blog/optimizing-my-finances/).\n\n📣 22. Self-promotion ≠ Bragging\n--------------------------------\n\nAny content creator starts off insecure.\n\nWhat will people say if I start making content on the internet?\n\nWell, especially in the beginning, nobody will say anything. Your audience will be small enough that it will likely attract no real attention. One of the first hurdles you'll have to get over is the self-promotion concept.\n\nIt may feel like bragging on the Internet at the beginning, but it will become natural over time.\n\nYou can promote yourself and your brand without bragging by:  \n→Building in public  \n→Sharing your tips and tricks  \n→Providing value to people, for free\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, subscribe to my newsletter via the form below to stay in the loop ♻️.",

      "content": "September 11, 2022\n\nFreelancing, or the practice of working on a contract-to-contract basis with multiple clients instead of a single employer, has been growing in popularity in the past years.\n\nEspecially with the pandemic and the rise of WFH and quiet-quitting culture, people have been looking into ways to expand their income streams.\n\nYou may ask yourself:\n\n> _Is this article for me if I am just an employee?_\n\nAnd the answer could be yes or no. I believe that most standard 9-to-5 jobs have some sort of alternative in the freelance sphere. We have seen professions such as physicians, lawyers, construction workers, etc., turn their face towards freelance. What freelance does is essentially remove the 9-to-5 boundaries, such as:\n\n*   Having to work a fixed schedule\n*   Having a single income stream\n*   Limited control over your work conditions\n\nSo with so many freelancers entering the career stage in 2022, you may ask yourself - how do I stand out?\n\nLuckily, whenever there is a large group of people, there are usually ways to quickly accelerate and stand out from the other 90%. In this article, I will go into 6 easy practices that have helped me become a better freelancer and shine when compared to competition.\n\nStarting off with…\n\n1\\. It’s all about communication\n--------------------------------\n\nThis is the prime factor which will generally differentiate between good freelancers and bad ones.\n\nYou would honestly be surprised by how low the standard for communication and correspondence can get - missed deadlines, rude remarks, bad customer service, etc.\n\nBy simply following these few guidelines, you can outclass most freelancers in terms of good communication with your clients.\n\n*   Create an automatic email campaign to onboard them, giving them full and clear instructions and expectations from the get-go.\n*   Update them with progress regularly.\n*   Make them feel like their opinion is appreciated - ask for feedback at the end.\n*   Offer a refund - then make your best effort so they don’t need to ask for it.\n*   Keep them in the loop with regular emails.\n\n2\\. Use the Full-time regime\n----------------------------\n\nThe 8-hour workday is often bashed for its lack of flexibility.\n\nHowever, when I first converted to freelance, I found it very helpful to still be able to adhere to the 8-hour workday for a few reasons:\n\n*   It helps you build a schedule\n*   It’s good in case you’re scatterbrained\n*   It usually intersects with the schedule of your clients which aids correspondence.\n\nWhat is more, by working 8 hours a day even as a freelancer, you can apply a specific strategy, which I call the 2-by-4 method.\n\nYou will sometimes have yourself in the situation where you have not enough or entirely too many clients. In that case, I would recommend you spend 4h a day working on your already-assigned projects, and spend the remaining 4h a day working on marketing - seeking out new clients. This way, you will get yourself an exemplary portfolio of work while still managing to find new clients simultaneously.\n\n3\\. Control your personal brand\n-------------------------------\n\nWhen you think of a “personal brand”, your mind will likely wander off to brand accounts on social media, which honestly feel like poor attempts of an AI to sound human.\n\nHowever, a real personal brand has more to do with your personality. It includes your presence on social media channels, the design and feel of your personal website, the authenticity you show.\n\nClients will find it much easier to relate to your message on a personal level if there is a person behind the brand. Also, credibility is more easily being provided - you are standing with your own face and name behind your services, so people will feel more secure that the work will be done responsibly.\n\n4\\. Grow a newsletter\n---------------------\n\nAh, email newsletters.\n\nIt would seem like email marketing is a dying trend likely to be unpopular in 2022, but surprisingly, there are plenty of 100k+ following newsletters that make insane profits to this day.\n\nMost of them aren’t even connected to particular businesses - they are the personal newsletters of public figures that attract a following through their message and regularly pitch their products and services.\n\nFor example, this blog is connected to a newsletter. So if you are subscribed, you will receive an education email and summary of my article of the week each Wednesday. When you provide value, you will later find it easier to attract clients through the very same audience you have been sending newsletters to.\n\n5\\. Collect testimonials\n------------------------\n\nDo you know why people would want a large social media following, apart from the purely vain aspects of it?\n\nIt’s due to the social proof.\n\nA Twitter account with 100k followers can spread the same message as a 1k Twitter, but their message will be largely amplified. And the same goes for freelancers.\n\nFor me, it was much easier to get clients doing digital illustrations after my 100th client than before them. And much of it comes from the testimonials of said clients.\n\nSo, whenever you finish a job, and you believe you did it well, don’t be shy to ask for a review - and then publish it on your website. It will help your reputation in the long term.\n\n6\\. Manage expectations\n-----------------------\n\nAnd for our last point, we want to relate back to the initial one with the importance of communication.\n\nAt the start of a project with a client, make sure you get these details straight with them and don’t deviate:\n\n*   What the deadline is\n*   How many corrections they get\n*   What is within your expertise\n*   What is outside of your abilities\n*   What they can get as bonuses",

      "content": "August 28, 2022\n\n> “_If I only had an hour to chop down a tree, I would spend the first 45 minutes sharpening my axe._” - **_Abraham Lincoln_**\n\nThe aforementioned quote perfectly describes one of the main laws of productivity - preparation beats action any day.\n\nAnd preparing for the upcoming academic year is one hell of an obstacle to act on without a plan. And, surprisingly, most people actually tackle it heads-on without a plan in mind. This is the reason why “good” students often continue to do moderately well til they graduate, and vice versa - _momentum_.\n\nSince we’re never taught proper study techniques, we usually follow our intuition on how studying works. We study the whole material just a few days before the exam, we postpone assignments till the last minute and generally try to minimise the time spent studying as much as we can - often at the cost of the quality of learning.\n\nHowever, both school and university are institutions that have existed for quite a while now. Even with the recent transition to online learning in some places, most of the underlying principles behind doing well in academia are the same. The academic year follows a relatively predictable structure, and it’s usually a repeatable one as well.\n\nFor example, with my Engineering modules at Uni, I have found some patterns in the optimal study techniques for each.\n\n1.  Essays follow a similar structure that you can templatise\n2.  Tutorials teach you the material through repeated problem-solving\n3.  Most of engineering can be boiled down to figuring out how to figure out things in a relevant context.\n\nWhat is more, preparing ahead of time and planning your goals is essential because…\n\n> “_You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems._” - _**James Clear**, author of “Atomic Habits”_\n\nAnd in this article, we will look into the **systems** you can purposefully build to increase your academic performance - ahead of time.\n\nYour calendar\n-------------\n\nMost students only start using a calendar, either a physical one or a digital one, when they go into university. Personally, I have been using one even in high school, courtesy to Thomas Frank’s inspiring videos that I was lucky to stumble into when I was 16:\n\nYour calendar is a powerful tool for a few reasons:\n\n*   It allows you to conceptualise how much time a task takes\n*   It helps you visualise any gaps in your schedule\n*   Helps you manage time on a 2D plane\n\nThe last one is also the reason why I personally prefer using a digital tool like **Google Calendar**. It allows me to move events around, reschedule, and most importantly, attach details to events. Now I can set the location of a lecture event, to know where I’m gonna be each day. It allows me to colour code all my business tasks in yellow to differentiate them from the green fitness events that I have spread out in the week. On that note, I can have multiple calendars within one app - and toggle their visibility on and off whenever I want to isolate for a specific area of my life.\n\nSo how is a calendar useful in an academic setting specifically?\n\nWell, ever since I got into uni, I also got into the habit of blocking out study time ahead of time. On a Sunday, I will look at the lectures and set-in-stone events for the following week and find out when I’ll have bigger gaps in my schedule. If I happen to be on campus for the whole day, and have time between lectures, I can use that to do some studying in the library instead of going back and forth.\n\nTip #2 for your calendar will be to allow for buffer time.\n\nI would describe buffer time as a countermeasure against unexpected delays. Say, something that often happens to me is that my laptop takes a long while to boot, and sometimes the loading kills productivity.\n\nThis is why, if my schedule allows, I will set bigger time intervals for tasks than what I know they usually take. An “Assignment” task that usually takes an hour? I’ll leave 90 minutes for it, so even if my laptop has the worst performance, I’ll still get it done in time before the next event.\n\nAlso, for tasks that happen at different locations, it’s important to allow for buffer time to reach those locations.\n\nAnalyse the 80/20\n-----------------\n\nWe all realise that tasks are not made equal, and our effort should be optimised, not maximised.\n\nFor example, when writing an essay, you are often given the guideline beforehand. In my experience with Engineering assignments, they follow this formula - most of the points you get from the results, discussion, and conclusion of the article, and less points are allotted to the introduction and methods sections.\n\nThis means that if you optimise your efforts into writing an amazing conclusion (a bit backwards, I know), your effort will be better rewarded.\n\nBasically, effort is effort, but the effort can have a different “reward” attached to it, depending on the way you allocate it.\n\nGet ahead\n---------\n\nYou know what you can do, that many people are scared to?\n\nAsk for notes.\n\nWe are often engulfed by the idea that we have to do everything on our own. Plus, for us, every subject at school or uni feels new and novel. This often hides the fact that those are games with preset rules - and other people have already walked those same routes.\n\nAsk your upperclassmen for notes, you’ll be surprised by the resources that could be available at your fingertips by just putting yourself out there. Also, on that note, try asking your classmates to share notes as well, while you’re both creating them. A shared Docs file that could be edited by a few people and is constantly fact-checked becomes invaluable as exam time approaches.",

      "content": "August 21, 2022\n\nI’ll be turning 22 this year. So far, ever since I was 18, I’ve had a normal job as a barista, and mainly did freelance ever after, to this day actually.\n\nWhen you’re still a student in university, and your income isn’t really great either, your ability to save and optimise your finances naturally develops. The alternative is to remain with empty pockets, which, while kind of expected while being a student, is nevertheless a harsh feeling.\n\nIt was through reading financial books that I figured out the importance of saving and investing. Here’s a list of them, in the order I read them, so you can get a clear picture of how my thinking developed.\n\n1.  “[**Rich Dad, Poor Dad**](https://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680194)” by R. Kiyosaki\n    \n    This book taught me the basic principles of income and expenses. It’s generally considered the best 1st book you can read on the topic of personal finances. Some of the main topics it covers are:\n    \n    *   Liabilities VS Assets\n    *   The differences between freelancers, employees, and businesspeople\n    *   Inflation\n    *   Why investing is important\n    *   Investing VS Saving\n    *   Short-term VS Long-term thinking\n2.  “[**I Will Teach You To Be Rich**](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/)” by R. Sethi\n    \n    For me this is the most influential of all the books in this list - it has taught thousands of people around the work how to achieve financial wellbeing and actually get rich through simple means. It goes into detail on the following:\n    \n    *   Is it that important to cut out on lattes? (being frugal)\n    *   How you can focus on the Big Wins instead of the Small Cuts\n    *   Principles of investing\n    *   Index funds, ETFs, Bonds, Target Date Funds (TDFs)\n3.  “**[The Little Book That Still Beats the Market](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Still-Beats-Market/dp/0470624159)**” by J. Greenblatt\n    \n    As the name suggests, the book is a short one, and it helps justify some investing ideas, including:\n    \n    *   How to make better research of a stock\n    *   How to not let the market eat your money\n4.  “**[The Total Money Makeover](https://www.amazon.com/Total-Money-Makeover-Classic-Financial/dp/1595555277)**” by D. Ramsey\n    \n    Now this is a classic in the genre. Truthfully, it’s mainly geared towards middle-aged US citizens, but it teaches the following:\n    \n    *   Debt - how to get rid of it or use it productively\n    *   How to escape the rat race\n    *   Thinking long-term about mortgages\n    *   Credit scores\n5.  “**[The Millionaire Fastlane](https://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Fastlane-Crack-Wealth-Lifetime/dp/0984358102)**” by MJ DeMarco\n    \n    This is one of the longer books in the list, and it works better as a manual, than as a simple book. It provides you with guidelines on how to live in 3 ways - as a Sidewalker, Slowlaner, and Fastlaner. It teaches the following:\n    \n    *   How to find a business niche\n    *   How to use your business to generate personal wealth\n    *   How to leverage your existing wealth to provide a good living\n6.  “**[The Psychology of Money](https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness/dp/0857197681)**” by M. Housel\n    \n    This book was the most psychological of the list, expectedly so from the headline. It goes over some concepts that we rarely give thought to, including:\n    \n    *   Why poor people gamble\n    *   Why different generations invest their money differently\n    *   What financial security means to different people\n\nOverall, these books lead me to generate a financial mantra and plan for myself, that I try my best to stick to. Of course, the plan sometimes deviates from the original idea, but the main concepts it follows are achieving financial freedom, preparing oneself for market volatility, and diversification. Let’s go over the ways I optimise my financials as a 22 year old, beginning with…\n\nThe Emergency Fund\n------------------\n\n![How_I_Optimize_my_Finances_at_22_Emergency_Fund](../../resources/images/blog/optimizing-my-finances/optimizing-my-finances-1.webp)\n\nYou may have heard the saying that the average person is one medical emergency or car breakdown away from homelessness and poverty. It’s very easy to be pushed off-track, and especially when you’re young, your network may not be stable enough to support your eventual falling.\n\nThis is why many of the authors in the book listed above advise you to create an _emergency fund_. It’s called like so because you aren’t supposed to use it for anything that isn’t an emergency. It should be a moderate amount of money (the value fluctuates from person to person, the idea is to bring you a sense of security), that you have stashed away in an easily-accessible bank account. It’s supposed to be liquid money - if you have it invested in something, withdrawing it in case of emergency will result in either a loss, tons of fees, or both. For me, a starting emergency fund for my modest income is about 600$, enough to get me through a month without having to pull from any investments.\n\nSpeaking of investments…\n\nInvesting Strategy\n------------------\n\nWhat I have learnt from the books I’ve read on investing and personal finances so far, is that the earlier we start investing, the better. “_Time in the market beats timing the market_”, as they say.\n\nSo for me it was a big thing and very crucial to start investing as early as possible, with very small sums to start with. I’m a bit ashamed to admit that my first ever “investment” was triggered by the Gamestop frenzy of 2020, and as expected, it resulted in a loss. However, instead of discouraging me, it made me realise that this was just the “entrance fee” to the University of Investing. A much bigger financial loss would have been to never go into investing in the first place. Also, it taught me several other things, including:\n\n*   Don’t be greedy\n*   Think of the long term\n*   Do your diligent research of the stock/index\n*   Expect volatility\n*   Don’t panic sell\n*   Don’t act on emotions, act on rationale\n\nSo, to get to the meat of my investing strategy, as Ramit Sethi recommends, I take advantage of my relatively young age and longer time horizon, and I am all-in on stocks in the moment. My current portfolio is 80% SP500 ETFs (an index fund that tracks the top 500 US companies), around 15% in Bitcoin (to take advantage of the crypto bear market), and the remaining 5% is in random stocks that I have put some spare cash in occasionally.\n\nThe thing with investing while young is that you have to get used to being in the red a lot. Just a small percentage of investors is consistently in the green just 2 years into their investing journey. However, once a decade has passed, I am pretty confident that the growth of the bulk of my portfolio would make it hard for it to ever go in the red.",

      "content": "August 17, 2022\n\nI first discovered Notion when I was just 19, in Year 1 of my Engineering course at university.\n\nIt was round about time for my exams, and I had to consolidate a ton of papers, notebooks, and study materials to prepare for one heave set of studying. This is when I stumbled upon a [video by no other than Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODl5FOMu8kI&t=696s). It pointed to this fascinating notes app that combined databases, simple pages, and was automatically syncing on all devices as you wrote. This app is **Notion**.\n\nFast-forward 2-3 years, and now Notion is an integral part of my day-to-day productivity. I have created interconnected study planners with it that helped me move with Distinction into Year 2 and Year 3 of uni, I am tracking my sleep and well-being data on Notion daily, and I am using it to manage my freelancing business. It’s also the place where I’m currently writing this article.\n\nI have recommended Notion to many people so far, and one of the main complaints I hear is that “Notion is simply too complicated”. You can create databases, relations, roll-ups, you can use formulas, progress bars, graphs, and more. This creates a rather steep learning curve that makes many people drop Notion before they even start to unravel the sleek functionality and cool designs they can make.\n\nThis is where _templates_ come in. Templates, as you may guess, are a way to preset and configure Notion to carry out a particular set of tasks. These templates can then be duplicated with just a click of a button, and anybody can have the same system in their own respective workspace. In this article, I will provide you with 4 unique templates that have helped me get my life in order. For the impatient among you, here is what you will be getting:\n\n1.  The University HQ Template\n2.  The Financial Goals and Budgeting Template\n3.  The Daily Tracking Database\n4.  The Investing and Net Worth Dashboard\n\nAnd now, let’s get started with the template that has helped me manage my academic life so far…\n\nUniversity HQ Template\n----------------------\n\n![Notion_Templates_that_helped_me_get_my_life_in_order_Uni_HQ](../../resources/images/blog/notion-templates/notion-templates-1.webp)\n\nThis Notion template is designed to provide the best experience for organising your academic life in Notion. It is specifically geared towards students in UK Universities, as it was crafted based on my own personal experience studying Biomed. Engineering in Scotland.\n\nOn its main HQ page, the template shows you all your modules (or classes, so to say), with your grades, assignments, and corresponding lecturers and contact info.\n\nFrom then on, on each \"Year X\" page you will find the specific classes you take each year, alongside all the responsible staff and assignments. What is more, you can add important documentation about your studies, as well as about your accommodation.\n\nThe additional _Timeline_ view of the assignments database ensures that you keep track of all your deadlines in a chronological fashion.\n\nYou can get the template for FREE [by following this link](https://yassenshopov.gumroad.com/l/uk-university-hq), or by [visiting my Notion shop](http://yassenshopov.com/notion/) and choosing among the many other professional templates.\n\nFinancial Goals Template\n------------------------\n\n![Notion_Templates_that_helped_me_get_my_life_in_order_Financial_Goals](../../resources/images/blog/notion-templates/notion-templates-2.webp)\n\nThis Notion template is a customisable database that will help you record you past, current, and future financial goals. One thing we all know intuitively is that \"what gets measured gets done\", and this database is built with this in mind.\n\n### **Visual Progress Bars**\n\nWith the help of a specially-made Formula property, you will be able to visualise the progress and performance for each of your goals. The progress bars will go up to 100%, after which you will be able to log your spending.\n\nEx: Let's say you are building up a fund for a new phone you want to buy.

      "content": "August 7, 2022\n\nWe can broadly categorise people into two different philosophies:\n\n1.  Those who believe life happens to them (external locus of control)\n2.  Those who believe they are responsible for what their life becomes (internal locus of control)\n\nIn reality, it's true that we cannot control every little or big thing that happens to us, so to an extent, we can't have a completely internal locus of control. What we can do, however, is treat life as something that we make out of the randomness around us.\n\nA book that helped me visualise this concept in an amazing manner is, surprisingly to me, the science-fiction survival story, \"The Martian\", by Andy Weir.\n\n\"The Martian\" follows the story of Mark Watney, an astronaut sent on a mission to Mars in 2035. Things go haywire really fast for him when an accident during evacuation leaves him stranded on the red planet - alone, without his team, and with no way of communicating with Earth. None of his crewmates knows he is alive on Mars, and he is left to his own devices to survive with the little resources he has.\n\nLuckily, Mark is a botanist by education and manages to develop a DIY garden for potatoes on the desolate Mars base. That, plus using what little leftover food he had from the mission, allowed him to physically survive and not die of malnourishment. This is just one example of the ton of ingenious tactics Mark uses to survive and to even attempt to return to Earth.\n\nIn this article, I will be going over the ways in which this science fiction novel inspired my \"Life Engineering\" philosophy, and how it provides a healthy mental framework for dealing with life's adversities.\n\nThe Survival Scenario\n---------------------\n\nWhile we are (luckily) not exposed to the elements in the same way Mark is, life can still be described as a battle for survival in a way. Yes, most of us live a relatively privileged life, knowing that we will always have some sort of support network to fall back on. However, in order to propel our lives forward, we mostly rely on our own capabilities and resources - the definition of survival.\n\nWhat fascinates me about the story in \"The Martian\" is the realistic storytelling. It would be a bland story if the main character always took the correct decisions with scientific precision and never got in trouble. That would read more like an instruction manual than a novel.\n\nIt becomes even more interesting, because Mark Watney actually _is_ a scientist. The decisions he takes are grounded in his knowledge of astronomy, physics, botanics. And still, realistically, his analysis sometimes overlooks something obvious, he is sometimes clumsy and forgetful, and even when his plan seems 100% fail-safe, there is always something additional to consider.\n\nThis all reflects very well what it is to be a living, breathing human. You can definitely improve your life with some planning, but we’re never in full control of what happens to us.\n\nScarcity VS Abundance\n---------------------\n\n![How_Life_Is_What_We_Make_of_it_Gif](../../resources/images/blog/life-design/life-design-1.webp)\n\nYou may have heard of “scarcity mindset” and “abundance mindset” before. They refer to two different modes of thinking about the world.\n\nPeople with a scarcity mindset believe that there are limited resources in the world - not everybody can be successful, not everybody can be rich, and there is not enough of anything for everyone. This often leads them to be more stingy, overly cautious and protective, because of this innate fear of resources running out. And as you can deduce, there is not a lot of space for growth in this type of mindset.\n\nPeople with an abundance mindset, on the other hand, perceive the world as an endless supply of opportunities - wealth and value can be generated from thin air without necessarily taking from someone else. People like that are often more generous, take more risks, and are less afraid of potential losses.\n\nIn my opinion, this is where personal growth truly happens. Now, back to “The Martian”.\n\nThe main character finds himself often in a situation where he has a limited supply. Mark can run out of food, oxygen, heat, water, and all of those could be fatal. However, if he had a scarcity mindset, he would have remained in his base for all eternity, afraid to stray away from his safe place, and would have never \\[SPOILER ALERT\\] returned back to Earth. It was the abundance mindset that got him out of the hole, and it was what gave him hope in the first place.\n\nThe purposelessness of modern tasks\n-----------------------------------\n\nWhile Mark’s mission in Mars almost always consists of life-critical tasks and responsibilities, he manages to keep a good mood some of the time and doesn’t let his hope wither out.\n\nSurprisingly, the average office worker at some corporation may have less drive and motivation under even the most perfect working conditions than Mark Watney has while his life is in danger and it seems impossible to survive at times. However, there is a simple reason behind that.\n\nIn modern society, we have developed business models that operate in a very farfetched manner. Sometimes a worker in a factory may never actually use the products they are creating, and often in a corporate setting, employees may be largely detached from the goals of the company. And usually, the bigger the company is, the less attachment the average worker has to their actual work and day-to-day tasks.\n\nThis is the reason why Mark is motivated to succeed in his tasks. His life is always on the line. Imagine if your life was **directly** affected by your day-to-day actions - if you don’t make yourself a healthy dinner, you die the next day, for example. It’s pretty much like that for the main character in “The Martian”, where he has to take into account almost every action of his, and any mistake can turn out to be fatal. Meanwhile, for us, our actions or inactions usually only affect us in the medium and long term. Everyday mediocre work may only lead you to get fired further down the line, if ever at all, in some jobs. If you miss out on workouts, it will only show when you’re 70 and pain starts forming in your joints.\n\nThis is why it’s important to strive to have a job with a mission, or at least one that you can closely see the effects. Higher-purpose jobs like vets, medics, social care workers, and others, see much higher “Gratification” rates when compared to other, usually more lucrative professions, and it’s the sense of purposelessness that dictates that.",

      "content": "July 24, 2022\n\nI first started drinking coffee in 10th grade, while I was still in high school in Bulgaria.\n\nJust to preface this story, and in case you want a short summary - I never developed a problem with drinking coffee or any significant bad side effects from the whole thing. Nevertheless, it’s been a few years now that I have been drinking on average 2 cups of coffee a day. I feel like, as with any substance, it’s a good thing to reflect on the habit and to reflect on the pros and cons of being a coffee drinker.\n\nI didn’t really start drinking coffee out of necessity, it was more of a “growing-up” tradition. My parents drink coffee every morning, and it was ingrained in me that it was the natural thing to do when growing up. Plus, when you put a few spoons of sugar into the mix, it becomes quite a tasty drink, even for non-drinkers.\n\nSo in the beginning, it was the easiest thing in the world to integrate it into my morning routine. As I often had to wake up at 6:30 am for school, it made sense to also drink a cup of coffee while waiting for my brain to boot up. Then, after a year or two, most of my friends were also drinking coffee so it became a social thing. Coffee shops have this great conversational atmosphere that I love, and almost every outing could become a coffee shop meetup eventually.\n\nThe thing was, while still in high school, I couldn’t really go over the line with coffee - my mum would know if I had a cup late into the night or if I simply had too many. So it wasn’t until I got my first job (as a barista, ironically), that I got to drink as much coffee as I wanted. On some work days, it went up to 4 cups daily, which definitely started getting me fidgety.\n\nThen came university, and with that, coffee started becoming more and more a part of my personality. I’m studying Engineering, and that goes hand-in-hand with some workload, so the running gag of engineering students having caffeine in their veins became a reality.\n\nAt that point, I had already stopped getting the positive effects of caffeine, like being energetic, and instead only suffered from withdrawal on the few days I went without a cup of coffee. Eventually, I could fall asleep directly after a cup of coffee, with none of the energising effects remaining. It was at about this time that I decided I need to lower my consumption, and preferably go cold-turkey for a month to get a feel of what it is to go without caffeine.\n\n![How_I_actively_manage_my_Caffeine_Addiction_Image](../../resources/images/blog/caffeine-addiction/caffeine-addiction-1.webp)\n\nCoffee detoxing\n---------------\n\nCoincidentally, it was at the same time that I started watching Matt D’Avella’s 30-day challenges on YouTube. He was going through a 30-day coffee detox, and that inspired me to try it out for myself.\n\nThe first few days were a pain, and not so much because of the withdrawal (I only had light headaches at the time), but mainly due to the force of habit. It had become a ritual for me, every time I sat down to study or do some work, to make a cup. And since I’m studying in the UK, the winter months made it extra important to have a warm drink every now and then.\n\nBut, difficult or not, I had to force myself through that initial week.\n\nAnd after maybe 14 days, it started getting easy. Waking up was no longer difficult since I naturally started going to bed at a normal time. So my body started adjusting to the normal sleep cycles, and I mostly felt tired and low-energy before sleep, which wasn’t a bad thing at all.\n\nAt about the time I reached the 30th day, I started missing the ritual of making coffee. I had switched to tea, but I am not naturally a tea-drinker, and it wasn’t my, well, cup of tea. So it was a big relief on day 31 when I had my first cup of coffee in a month.\n\nSo far, I have done such a detox twice, and I want to keep doing a 1-month “detox” every year or so. Caffeine is a substance that actively numbs the adenosine receptors in the brain, which creates the effect of addiction - the more you consume, the more adenosine receptors you develop. This means that you will grow sleepier faster once you stop drinking coffee, and the whole thing turns into a cursed cycle.\n\nHere are my two key takeaways from my caffeine detoxes:\n\n1.  It helps you realise that you can be just as awake and focused without caffeine as you were with it.\n2.  It makes you actually enjoy the coffee flavour, instead of focusing on the “power boost” it gives you.\n\nThe real reason we drink coffee\n-------------------------------\n\nIn my eyes, caffeine addiction, like any other type of addiction, has its roots in a deeper place. Now, the side effects of caffeine are much milder than those of other substances, but there is still some psychology behind coffee consumption.\n\nFor myself, I have identified 3 main reasons I consume coffee on the daily.\n\n1.  It is a warm beverage in the cold weather.\n2.  Classical conditioning - you start drinking coffee because it gives you energy. Then, even when it no longer makes you feel more awake, you keep having it because you are used to the thought of it bringing you positive energy.\n3.  It’s a type of coping strategy. Most of us start drinking coffee to cope with the high intensity of school or university, so it becomes a treasured item - an energy booster. This makes coffee the type of beverage you have when you’re in a rut, and when you need to _feel_ more productive, without necessarily being more productive.\n\nPoint #3 is the main reason I believe that making coffee should be more like a ritual. Because of the few steps it takes to make a good cup of coffee (grinding, pouring, mixing, etc.), the focus moves to the drink and the warm feeling it gives you. This makes it harder to get addicted to caffeine itself, something that tends to happen when you go overboard with instant coffee, for example.\n\nBy adding some steps between yourself and the addictive substance, you differentiate between the acts of engaging with caffeine and making yourself a cup of coffee.",

      "content": "July 17, 2022\n\nYou may have heard the saying “time is money” a few dozen times before.\n\nWell, we can also argue that “money is time” - when you have more money, you can afford to hire people to do the stuff you don’t want to do yourself, which frees you up to do whatever you want. Yet, in society, we cannot exchange value through the means of “time” alone. It would look like a dystopian reality if we worked for _seconds_ and _minutes_ as a currency, don’t you think?\n\nIt makes more sense to quantify the currency numerically, through something objective - like money. But it begs the question, with both time and money, what are we actually conceptualising here?\n\nI believe that what we substitute with “money” or “time” is what we call **value**. We create value, we receive value, and luckily, there are ways in which we can also accumulate value.\n\nIn this article, I will explain my mental model of what makes a wealthy and fulfilling life - that is, a life with a lot of accumulated value.\n\nTo better understand this framework, we need to dive deeper in the meaning of value in our society.\n\nValue, by definition, is “_the importance, worth, or usefulness of something_”. We can also use the word “effort” in this context. As I mentioned already, we can:\n\n1.  Generate value - by creating things, building, working, investing, spending time, essentially giving out a bit of ourselves to achieve something external.\n2.  Receive value - by buying things, using services, taking up space, renting, essentially any act of exchanging some sort of accumulated value for somebody else’s form of value.\n3.  Accumulate value - by keeping material possessions, saving money, owning real estate, essentially being in possession of some form of value that can be exchanged to receive value in return.\n\nAs you can now see, money is just one form of value you can own.\n\nIn my ponderings, and after reading some essays on the topic, I have reached the following conclusion - there are 6 important elements in life that can be used to store value. I will go over each one, but here is a list in the beginning for all of you who need a TL;DR tag.\n\n*   Money\n*   Data/Information\n*   Time\n*   Status\n*   Energy\n*   Soul\n\nI must admit, the “Soul” element probably has a better name for what it stands for, but I’m using it as a placeholder till I figure it out.\n\nLet’s start with the most obvious medium of value, money.\n\nMoney\n-----\n\nMoney itself comes in different forms, and has been used as a store of value for as long as society has been a thing. Whether it is gold coins, paper notes, cryptocurrencies, real estate, there has always existed some way for people to exchange value, items, and services between each other.\n\nIt is also, ironically indeed, the easiest from the 6 forms of value to accumulate. The processes in our society are geared in such a way to allow for the accumulation of wealth - we have created jobs, business, the economy, investments. Yes, it isn’t an easy game to play, but it is fairly structured. And with enough time and luck, it could be considered one of the more direct ways in which one can accumulate value.\n\nMoney can also very easily be converted into all the other types of value. As mentioned before, you can buy your time back with a given amount of money through services. You can acquire a large set of information and even get more energetic (fit and healthy) with the help of money.\n\nIn a way, society has helped us by commodifying other forms of value and making them exchangeable against money.\n\nData\n----\n\nIf you’re a frequent reader of my writing, there is a big chance you’re into productivity, self-development, maybe even knowledge-management tools like Notion.\n\nI feel like I, and maybe some of you, belong to this subset of people with a strong inclination to store knowledge as a sort of safety net. In my Notion workspace, I have a whole personal library of resources on all topics I’ve encountered - medicine, programming, marketing, psychology, business, technology, etc.\n\n![6_Elements_of_a_Well-engineered_Life_Data](../../resources/images/blog/6-elements/6-elements-1.webp)\n\nThe data aspect of value is where I believe people can figure out how to create a well-engineered life. When you start out the “game of life” you are given some guidelines - go to school, do well in academics, work a job, profit”, but then once you grow up you realise that the society we live in offers much less instructions and so many more opportunities than expected. And you come to this realisation through the increase in knowledge, or data points, as you grow up. The best skill you can invest in, in my eyes, is to learn how to **figure out stuff**. Google is your friends, YouTube is like free university, and there is so much to be learned from the people all around us, that the sheer amount of “free value” simply hanging around is obscene.\n\nThis is why I believe that Data, while maybe not as straightforward to acquire as Money, is the most abundant resource in our age - after all, there is a reason we call it the Information Age.\n\nTime\n----\n\nNow, Time as a store of value is interesting. Mainly because it is very difficult to accumulate.\n\n![6_Elements_of_a_Well-engineered_Life_Time](../../resources/images/blog/6-elements/6-elements-2.webp)\n\nNobody guarantees you will have more time, both literally and metaphorically. Even if we get promised to 100% live to a certain age, nobody can guarantee that the time spent till you die will be the most pleasant.\n\nIn a sense, time is a store of value in the sense that it can always be exchanged to acquire the greatest joys in life - you cannot enjoy life without having the time to do so. So in a way, we are accumulating the other 5 types of value in order to be able to enjoy more of our time. The additional aspect is that by raising more money to your name, achieving higher status and so on, you increase both the quality of time you will have in the future, and the amount of time you’ll live in a literal sense. So, this is the way we can accumulate value in the form of time - invest in activities and projects that will allow us to live longer and enjoy free time.\n\nStatus\n------\n\n![6_Elements_of_a_Well-engineered_Life_Status](../../resources/images/blog/6-elements/6-elements-3.webp)\n\nStatus is a form of value that varies massively in form from person to person. When you are just a student, you may not realise the importance of having a good network of friends and connections.\n\nThen, say, you enter a low stage of your life, and you realise how crucial it is to have a support network. To have people you trust, and have people who trust you. Or say, you’re looking for a job or trying to start a business venture - in all cases, it doesn’t hurt to have a wide and high-quality network of people to rely on for help.\n\nWays in which you can invest in the Status aspect of value include:\n\n*   Spending time with loved ones and friends\n*   Going out of your comfort zone to meet new people\n*   Investing your energy into deepening the relationships you already have\n\nEnergy\n------\n\nYou may have heard people suggest you don’t “waste” your precious 20s chasing cash, or chasing low-quality fun since those are the times at which you are most youthful.\n\nNow, while this isn’t necessarily true (there are many elderly people and adults with higher energy levels than some teenagers), the sentiment hold truth - Energy is a resource that we ought to keep in mind.\n\nIn the aspect of energy as a store of value, we can include both your levels of physical health and the mindset you have. Many people choose to spend their time and short-term energy on working out, not because it is the most fun activity, but because of the health benefits. You can think of it as an investment in your Energy in the long term.\n\nThe weird thing about energy as a form of value is that in order to increase your energy reserves, you often need to completely empty them in the short term. It’s kinda counter intuitive. Working out, for example, is a way to increase your vitality, but will leave you sore and tired at the end of it. Nevertheless, it’s crucial to invest in your high energy reserves - it won’t be fun to have all the time and money in the world but lack the health as an old person.\n\nSoul\n----\n\nPhew, we reached the last, and I admit, worst-named by me aspect of wealth.\n\nBut we cannot risk bypassing it - to engineer a good life for yourself, you must focus on the spiritual aspect of it as much, if not more, than the material and physical aspects. A rich soul can look differently to different people and there is no single recipe for it. There are some aspects to it that I think are pretty universal though - introspection, meditation, empathy and compassion, understanding yourself and others better, finding passions, chasing your dreams.\n\nIt may be last in order on this list, but that doesn’t mean it should be left for the very last place in your day-to-day life. Enriching yourself emotionally and spiritually through creative work, consuming meaningful content and interacting with people is something that can be integrated into your routines and will definitely help you in the long term.",

      "content": "July 10, 2022\n\nIn 2020, right when COVID-19 hit, my academic year in University was cut short - then I found myself with more time than expected on my hands.\n\nI had been considering the idea of making money on the Internet for some time before that. Since my first job ever was at a local coffee shop, I had quickly realised that customer service jobs weren’t really my jam. No hard feelings on that front, I did enjoy learning tons about coffee and only occasionally running into a rude customer.\n\nBut the question remained - how does one actually proceed with making money on the Internet? Of course, I had seen quite a few success stories online, but people like that always seemed miles ahead and almost unreachable in scope.\n\nThis is when luck and boredom blessed me together in the midst of the first lock-down. I had enough time on my hands to revisit my old passion for art - and more particularly, digital art. I had a graphic tablet in one of my drawers, nothing expensive, just enough to bring my drawings to the digital canvas. And let me tell you, my initial drawings in those first months were _decent_ at best. [You can see for yourself over here](https://instagram.com/kofiscrib), it’s quite humbling to see what almost all amateur art starts off as.\n\n![How_I_Made_My_First_Dollar_Previous_Work](../../resources/images/blog/my-first-dollar/my-first-dollar-1.webp)\n\nMy first commissioned drawing came around April 2020, and it was for the magnificent 3$! I was in awe, I could actually make money through my art, and this spirit has been with me ever since.\n\nIt was a given though, that I needed to hone my art skills quite substantially if I wanted to keep the money machine running. That first digital art commission was a bit closer to a donation anyway, and it wasn’t because my art was a masterpiece at all. However, it was enough to incentivise me, and give me momentum to get it started. I was now a digital content creator!\n\nHow I built an income stream\n----------------------------\n\nThe first few commissions came from Instagram, where I have been building an audience for a while. Here is a bit of hope for you: I think I had ~500 followers at the time of my first commission, and they have since increased to almost 9k at this point in time.\n\nHowever, I had to increase my reach somehow - my posts in the beginning were simply not reaching enough people who would consider commissioning me draw digital art for them. So I decided to move forward with some social media expansion.\n\nTwitter was a viable option at the time, but there is one reason why Twitter didn’t work for me in terms of digital art. It was because of the types of users it attracts. The average Twitter art enjoyer follows so many different art accounts that your drawing simply disappears into the void most of the time. Even a true fan may end up not seeing it because of the pure volume of content being created by the second. We could argue that a similar problem exists in Instagram, but at least your “Profile” section remains consolidated and actually resembles a portfolio. This means that when someone happens to visit your profile, they are still exposed to your portfolio of drawings, and may end up following you. With Twitter, it’s a tad bit more difficult in that regard.\n\nSurprisingly, my art found good success on Tumblr. Tumblr is a relatively unknown social media nowadays, but it used to be the OG blogging platform. It is currently the best place for people in different fandoms to catch up on fanarts, fanfictions, and other artistic material. I was so pleasantly surprised that Tumble people actually liked my content that I wrote another blog post on the [topic of Tumblr as a social platform for creators](https://kofiscrib.com/blog/creative-virgo/is-tumblr-dead).\n\nThe common denominator for all platforms though, was a simple question: How do I build a respectable portfolio when I don’t have that many clients in the beginning?\n\nThe solution turned out to be a simple one, even though it took me a long while to realise. When you don’t have clients in the beginning, you have more time to spend on projects _to attract more clients_. Later, when you already have the clients, this will be the main part of your work - working on their projects. But in the beginning, to build a portfolio, you need to do some fan projects, essentially build and provide value for free.\n\nI believe that building a portfolio is a long-term goal, and is something that can be tweaked and expanded every day by a little bit.\n\nSo, fast-forward 2 years, it’s now 2022 and I have a semi-regular stream of past clients who provide me with the occasional commission. Since it’s a freelance craft, it’s still an irregular type of income, but I can now expect to be approached by clients much more often than before. It helps a lot when you add that you have 2+ years of experience in the craft in your portfolio - this slowly builds up the moat between beginners and experts in a domain.\n\nWhen do I raise my prices?\n--------------------------\n\nIf you have ever sold some type of digital product or service, you will know the struggle of **pricing**. We often tend to undervalue the time and energy it takes us to go from a blank canvas to a finished piece. And it’s not like one price fits all creators and all products. A drawing may take me 3 days, while it takes Picasso one day, but that doesn’t mean that I shall price my work 3x higher than his.\n\nHere are some parameters to take into consideration when pricing your product or service:\n\n*   Time it takes to complete\n*   Expertise/Knowledge/Unique value you can provide\n*   Materials and resources you need\n*   Competition\n\nAnd once you have priced your work and had a few clients, you will probably reach realisation #2:\n\n> Is it time to raise my prices?\n\nPeople would give you different answers to this conundrum, but the main takeaway for me is to take 2 things into consideation.\n\n1.  How much your style/the value you provide has increased in quality.\n2.  How much more expertise have you gained.\n\nMy current model is to have a base price for one unit of work (in my case it is 40$ for a Digital Artpiece of one humanoid character, which usually takes me 3-4 to complete), and then add to the price with the added difficulty. You need me to draw 2 characters instead of one? Then the price increases to 60$. Background? 10$ more and it is a deal.\n\nThis way, I have set boundaries for the work I provide and now not every purchase is a price negotiation.\n\nAs for the long term, I tend to make some changes to my pricing every 6 to 12 months. I believe this is the right amount of time to have grown as an artist enough to increase your prices. Keep in mind, my first commission was just 3$, so it took some time to go from 0 to 100.\n\nHow to deal with confused clients\n---------------------------------\n\nI have encountered more people in my life that do not know a lot about digital art than such that do. Many people have some prejudice that “the computer makes it so easy to draw” or that it just takes no materials (as in paint, pencils, etc.), _thus_ it should be ridiculously low-priced, if not free.\n\nOften, I also meet people online who are well-intentioned, but are not sure what they want as a client. Do they commission me to draw an original character (OC) of theirs? Do they order a commission as a gift for a loved one? There seem to be so many options when speaking with an artist that clients go into analysis paralysis.\n\nI have found a way to make the process easier for them.\n\nFrom the get-go, they see my product sheet, as you can also see below.\n\n![How_I_Made_My_First_Dollar_Portfolio](../../resources/images/blog/my-first-dollar/my-first-dollar-2.webp) ![How_I_Made_My_First_Dollar_Portfolio](../../resources/images/blog/my-first-dollar/my-first-dollar-3.webp)\n\nThey can see that I mainly specialise in human-like characters in a semi-anime style. It could also lean into the “Dungeons and Dragons” direction, and my style is notorious for the bold colour choices.\n\nThis makes it easier for the client to make the decision right-away - they either like what they see and can imagine their own idea in my style or they don’t. And this helps in weeding out the bad clients from the good ones every time.\n\nKeeping the client happy\n------------------------\n\nThe last takeaway I made on the topic of making money with your art online is to provide a good service. This doesn’t mean to just make good art though.\n\nMore often than not, my drawings are not the thing that makes clients enjoy the process so much. It’s the communication, the timely notifications, the transparency, the feeling of engagement in the process.\n\nI have found that it is extremely important to do the following when you are commissioned a drawing:\n\n*   Set deadlines and expectations from the beginning.\n\nIn my case, I provide a rough draft, a coloured version, and a final drawing in 3 different stages so the client can see the progress and request alterations if need be.\n\n*   Be transparent.\n\nIf your client has a clear idea of what they will receive as a final product, they would be much happier. The way I provide transparency is by showing them previous work of mine in the beginning, so they can imagine what their own characters would look like in my style.\n\n*   Make them part of the process.\n\nThe way I accomplish this is by asking for feedback, getting to know the client’s taste and catering to it.\n\nSo overall, it has been quite the journey since my first 1$ online. I can’t say for now that I have “made it” as a content creator _yet_, but I feel like I have made some progress since 2 years ago, and I believe my story would be helpful in your own artistic journey as well.",

      "content": "July 3, 2022\n\nNotion is currently one of the most popular productivity apps on the market. Its versatility and customization features make it the favourite app for business owners, managers, solo entrepreneurs and content creators like myself.\n\nIt allows you to combine the functionality of databases, notes, workspaces, Kanban boards, galleries and much more. All of this, combined with the additional feat of autosaving to cloud storage make it a powerful player in the productivity sphere.\n\nHowever, with all these extra functions comes a heavy price to pay - and that is page speed.\n\nIt's become a running joke among Notion users that the fans of our computers go off every time the app is launched. Whether this is due to inefficient programming (since Notion's userbase grew exponentially in recent years) or whether it's simply too much to ask for - Notion does have a speed lag that sometimes messes up the user experience.\n\nIn this article, I will go into several ways in which one can increase the page load speed of their workspace. Some of these tricks are straightforward and will reduce Notion's computational load, while others are a bit more conceptual. Whichever you pick, here are some ways to make your Notion workspace run a lot faster.\n\nReduce the sizing of your images\n--------------------------------\n\nMaybe it hasn't occurred to you if you don't use Notion too often, but one of the biggest impacts to speed is the sizing of the images on the page.\n\nThis includes the cover image, the logo, and any other image and visual elements on the page itself.\n\n![](../../resources/images/blog/how-to-make-notion-fast/how-to-make-notion-fast-1.webp)\n\nMany people, including myself, decide to populate our pages with aesthetically pleasing gifs and images. However, this makes Notion take much longer to load. You can see the page that I used to have as the main page for my Notion workspace - it has a gif as a cover and a few widgets. From my experience, I can tell you that it took 10+ seconds to load on a relatively good Internet speed, and then every next interaction with the page (like click or drag) took a few extra seconds here and there.\n\nThe problem was easily resolved when I took the time to manage the image files. When I chose the gif or image for the cover, I went through an online converter and converted it to a smaller, more compressed image format - like JPG or WEBP. The same can be done for all logos, and then all other images throughout your workspace.\n\nBe cautious with widgets\n------------------------\n\nAh, widgets.\n\nThe glorious widgets we add to customize our Notion workspaces in all sorts of ways. These widgets include counters, progress bars, timelines, clocks, as you saw above, and many more.\n\nThe widgets themselves are a great addition to the workspace. The problem comes with their usual way of functioning. Since Notion itself is web-based, it constantly makes data requests to and from the web. This means that, with widgets such as the clock one, it needs to make an HTTP request to a browser every second to generate and preview the right content.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that widgets are forbidden for fast workspaces, but their presence is still carrying a rather big load to Notion's speed. So what I would do is use them sparingly and only on specific pages when needed.\n\nArchive and delete often\n------------------------\n\nAt one point, I decided to do a \"quick\" backup of my Notion workspace. If you are wondering, [you can find out how to do it yourself here](https://www.notion.so/help/back-up-your-data).\n\n![](../../resources/images/blog/how-to-make-notion-fast/how-to-make-notion-fast-2.webp)\n\nAmazingly, the total number of pages on my personal Notion workspace was 8,000+! And that's not counting the individual page sizes which varied across the workspace. Yes, the bulk of those came from my to-do list, which has been expanding incrementally over time.\n\nThis means that there is a simple trick you can do to make your Notion workspace go a bit faster. You can go over your to-do list database, for example, and routinely archive or delete any old content you feel like you don't need anymore. For example, some of my earliest to-do list entries allude to lectures and assignments that are long behind me, and I no longer need to be reminded of them.\n\nDoing this cleanup routinely ensures you keep a \"healhty\" Notion workspace and betters its performance significantly.\n\nUse a tree structure\n--------------------\n\nThe Tree Folder Structure is simple, and you have probably been taught about it in your first IT classes in school. In essense, it comes down to starting off with 1 main root and then branching off to multiple main folders. Let's follow the example I personally use in my workspace to get a better view.\n\nTo start off, the main page in my workspace is my Command Centre. This is the first page I see when I open the app and all the other pages are inside of it, directly or indirectly. You may wonder whether it's not actually a cluttered mess, but you will be surprised.\n\nThe next main step is to configure the main branches. Inside the Command Centre I have created different databases, the main one of which is my Pillars database. Each Pillar represents an important aspect of my life - Health, Business, Education, Social. Once we go into the Education pillar, I can find all the data for my University courses, extracurricular activities, courses, projects, and so on. It all goes under the hood of the education pillar.\n\nHaving the folder structure set up in this specific way makes the navigation process easier for two reasons.\n\n1.  When I'm in that Anatomy lecture, I know that all the folders and pages I'll need are in the Education pillar, so I don't have to remember their individual \"breadcrumbs\".\n    \n2.  When 2 pages are closely related in Notion, it becomes faster to search them up. The loading speed is directly proportional to their proximity in folders.\n    \n\nAnd those were the few tips I have proven to work in increasing your Notion workspace's operating speed. You may not notice the difference immediately, but I am sure that those habits and quick fixes will build up to revolutionize your productivity.",
